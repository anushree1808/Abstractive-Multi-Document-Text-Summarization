{"root":[{"title":"Airtel, Idea, RCOM drop on fears of fierce bidding","content":"Biswajit Baruah, ET Bureau Mar 28, 2015, 04.07AM IST(Reflecting the mood, analysts\u2026) MUMBAI: Shares of telecom companies such as Bharti Airtel, Idea Cellular and Reliance Communications (RCOM) dropped more than 5% on Friday on fears of aggressive bidding for airwaves, a development that may exert pressure on companies' balance sheets and cash flow, and restrict their expansion plans. Reflecting the mood, analysts maintained a cautious outlook on the sector, saying fresh buyers should stay away from this space in the near-term. On Friday, the department of telecommunications (DoT) released details of bidders at the recently concluded airwaves auction, where the government mopped up Rs 1.1 lakh crore from the spectrum put up for auction. The prices for the spectrum were considerably higher than the reserve price, said analysts. \"Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular have paid a little more for the spectrum than what the markets were expecting,\" said Mayuresh Joshi, VP, (institutional) Angel Broking. \"Going forward, Reliance Jio's pricing for its services would be closely watched. However, investors should note that the overhang on telecom stocks over spectrum is probably over.\" Telecom stocks came under intense selling pressure on Friday \u2014 Bharti Airtel fell 5.64% to Rs 376. Idea Cellular dropped 4.96% to Rs 171 after touching new 52-week high of Rs 187 in early trade. RCOM touched a new 52-week low of Rs 56.90 before closing at Rs 58.25, down 3.56%, while Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) ended 1.54% lower at Rs 7.68. Shares of some telecom companies \u2014 Bharti Airtel, Idea Cellular \u2014 have had a good run in the past one year, gaining 21% and 23%, respectively, while Reliance Communications dropped 53%; all these stocks have underperformed the ET 100 Index which gained nearly 27% over the same period. \"We reiterate our cautious view on the telecom sector, given the stretched balance sheets, rising capital expenditure, regulatory pushback, Reliance Jio's launch overhang, and expensive valuations,\" said Vinay Jaising, analyst at Morgan Stanley. They are also sceptical of Indian telecom companies due to a number of structural issues such as cannibalisation of voice by data, rapid expansion and network operational cost to deliver data, pricing impact from the imminent entry of Reliance Jio, and stretched balance sheets due to spectrum prices. \"Telcos will further bloat their balance sheet with debt, which is already under severe strain. We maintain 'hold' rating for Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular with a price target of Rs 399 and Rs 167\/share, respectively,\" said Amar Mourya, research analyst at IndiaNivesh. Most telecom companies may report negative free cash flow in 2015 as they are required to pay a quarter of the committed amount in the spectrum auction upfront, and the rest will be paid in installments over 10 years from 2017.","pubdate":"Sat, 28 Mar 2015 04:07:22 +0530","newspaper":"Economic Times"},{"title":"Sustained growth makes Kajaria Ceramics a good long-term bet","content":"Narendra Nathan, ET Bureau Jan 26, 2015, 08.00AM IST(Analysts say Kajaria Ceramics\u2026) We recommended Kajaria Ceramics a year back because of its high growth rate and decent valuations. The company has rewarded its investors by outperforming the benchmark index, Sensex, handsomely during this time. Kajaria Ceramics continues to grow at a fast pace. It has reported a 30 per cent growth in revenue in the third quarter of 2014-15 compared to the same quarter previous year. The net profit jumped 55 per cent because of a 29 per cent increase in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, and a fall in interest cost due to reduction in debt.  Analysts say Kajaria Ceramics will maintain its high growth in the coming years, largely because of conducive industry dynamics. For the past several years, the Indian tiles industry has been growing due to urbanisation, affordability of tiles, and consumers' focus on home aesthetics, aided by rising disposable incomes. This growth rate is expected to accelerate in the coming years because of the new government's increased focus on affordable housing and the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. Going by its performance, Kajaria should be able to beat the industry growth rates. In the next five years, Kajaria Ceramics is aiming to grow its revenue at a compound annual growth rate of 20 per cent. Close to 15 per cent of this growth will come from an increase in volume. The remaining will be a result of an increase in prices and a customer shift to premium brands. Kajaria Ceramics is also expanding capacity. It will be spending up to Rs 200 crore in the next fiscal year towards this purpose. Though the company will continue to focus on its tiles business, which accounts for 90 per cent of its turnover, it has entered the sanitaryware and sanitary-fittings segment. Its sanitaryware plant is already operational and is expected to reach full production by March 2015. Even though margins are expected to remain at the current 15 per cent-plus level, the fall in the natural gas price will bring down costs and should help the entire sector expand margins. The historical PE of 35 may appear high, but analysts say, because of the strong volume growth, pricing power, healthy margins and a strong balance sheet\u2014very low debt, which is being cut further\u2014it is justified. But, bear in mind, the company, and the entire Indian tiles industry, faces a threat from Chinese imports. Any policy shift that serves to boost tiles export from China, will adversely impact the entire industry, including Kajaria.

These companies are unlikely to reap the full impact of the festive season in the December 2014 quarter. The festive sales were split between September and December due to early Navratri and Diwali in 2014. Along summer and an early festive season led to a strong first half for these companies, giving many investors an impression that the demand has bounced back for discretionary products post-election. A base effect, thanks to lower sales in the year-ago period, also boosted the numbers and fuelled sentiment.  There was a growth of 27-57% in sales for the September quarter and 25-39% in the first half of FY15. The earnings growth figures were even higher. The result was a surge in stock prices (See table). But, random checks (while talking to dealers and mall outlets) suggest that the sales in the December quarter have been less than impressive. One spots a similar trend in other consumer discretionary sectors like passenger vehicles and two-wheelers. For instance, Hero Moto reported minus 2% growth YoY for the December quarter, Bajaj Auto recorded minus 1% growth YoY while M&amp;M closed the quarter minus 12% YoY growth. Maruti was an exception, generating a 12% growth YoY. While analysts are justifying current high valuations \u2014 claiming that these companies will benefit from the correction in steel, copper and aluminium prices \u2014 a weak sales growth may keep sentiments sombre.","pubdate":"Tue, 13 Jan 2015 05:14:13 +0530","newspaper":"Economic Times"},{"title":"Balkrishna Industries: A long-term bet after the recent correction","content":"Narendra Nathan, ET Bureau Jan 5, 2015, 08.00AM IST(Balkrishna Industries\u2026) The profits of Balkrishna Industries fell by around 40% after reporting poor numbers in the second quarter of 2014-15. The tyre company's net profit went down by 17% compared to the corresponding period last year and by 22% compared to the preceding quarter. Lower volume from European markets (the region contributes around 50% of its sales volume) and the discounts offered to clients to compensate the fall in natural rubber prices are the primary factors behind the fall in net profit.  Balkrishna Industries could not take advantage of the lower prices of natural rubber in the second quarter because it had a huge inventory of rubber purchased at higher prices. Rising employee costs following partial commissioning of its new tyre plant with 1.5 lakh per annum capacity in Bhuj, Gujarat, was another factor. The recent correction in its price has brought the valuations of Balkrishna Industries to reasonable levels. In addition to the fall in price, analysts are getting bullish on this niche player because of its improving fundamentals. Its Bhuj plant is expected to become fully operational by April 2015. This will help the company to foray into much bigger radial tyres (expected to move up from 35 inches to 57 inches) and, therefore, its tyre portfolio will be more comprehensive. Radial tyres have higher realisations (3-4% higher) and with this new plant, its radial sales volume is expected to move up from around 30% now to above 40% over the next three years. Balkrishna Industries is also working towards increasing its global market share in the off -highway tyres (OHT) from 5% to 8% in the next three years. To realise this goal, the company plans to set up warehouses in the US and other overseas markets in the near future to increase its penetration levels. Though the global fall in agricultural product prices has resulted in less demand for new tractors (lower demand for OEM tyres), existing tractors continue to work (normal demand for tyres in the replacement segment , which is nearly 80% of its total sales volumes). New tractor sales are also expected to improve following the stability in the American farm sector reported recently. With around 90% of its revenues coming from exports, Balkrishna Industries will also benefit from the sudden depreciation of the rupee in the last six months.

Orient Cement's per tonne cement production cost is around 13% lower than the industry average. Therefore, the company could repeat its stellar performance in the third quarter of 2014-15 as well. In its second quarter sales, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) and net profit grew by 20%, 123% and 200%, respectively, compared to the corresponding period last year, or on a year-on-year basis. The company could also improve its third quarter EBITDA per tonne to `785, which is among the highest in the industry. The rise in EBITDA per tonne was due to the strong volume growth (up by 4% y-o-y) and improvement in realisations (up by 15% y-o-y). Orient Cement is a good long-term bet because of the infrastructure growth expected in the company's two key markets\u2014Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh\u2014in the coming years. Industrial demand is expected to pick up in Maharashtra following the initiatives by the new state government. Andhra Pradesh, however, is the best example of the amount of harm political uncertainties can do to even well-established companies. The market size of cement has shrunk to 13 million tonnes in the state from the peak levels of 18 million tonnes in 2008-09. However, due to the low cost of production, Orient Cement could increase its market share.  Cement consumption should jump in Andhra Pradesh in the coming years as massive construction projects are lined up at the new state capital. To benefit from this, the mid-sized cement company is in the process of increasing capacity through green-field and brown-field projects. The company's 3 million tonne green-field project in Gulbarga (northern Karnataka) is progressing smoothly. Its trial production and, subsequently, commercial production is expected from April 2015 and June 2015, respectively. This project also includes a 45MW thermal plant and a 7MW waste-heat-recovery plant. Despite the key advantages, such as low-cost cement production, high return on equity (ROE) and return on capital employed (ROCE), this stock is still attractively priced compared to its peers.

While its net profit rose by 50% year-on-year, it zoomed by 98% on a quarter-on-quarter basis. The rise in net profit was primarily due to two factors: first, there was a 316% y-o-y jump in its other income which was triggered by the profit it made from sale of investments. Second, the company reported 14% y-o-y increase in rating revenues, which was significantly higher than the 5% achieved by its main competitor Crisil during the period under consideration. In addition to the increase in surveillance income, Care also added 761 clients during the quarter and its total volume of debt instruments rated increased by 16% y-o-y.  Analysts are now getting bullish on the long-term (2-3 years) growth opportunities for the credit rating sector because it is best placed to benefit from the cyclical recovery in corporate capex and bank credit growth. The sector is already doing well because of the pickup in debt issuances in the recent past. According to Prime Database, debt placements during the first half of 2014-15 went up by 22% compared to the corresponding period last year. Another factor helping credit rating agencies is the improvement in credit environment. For example, Care's modified credit ratio (MCR) has improved from 1.05 times to 1.25 times in the second quarter, y-o-y. MCR is calculated by dividing the number of rating upgrades with downgrades. An increase in MCR means that the financials of the rated companies are stable and improving. With a turnaround in the economy, MCR is expected to improve further in the second half of 2014-15. With the revival in market sentiments, debt issuances are expected to rise manifold, increasing business opportunities for rating agencies like Care. Since the company provides 'grading' for equity public offerings, revival in stock market sentiments also bodes well for it. While analysts are bullish on the sector, Care is their preferred choice. This is so because it is the cheapest stock based on valuations and the recent correction has brought down its valuations further to reasonable levels. It is quoting at 35 times trailing price-to earnings ratio compared to 51 times for Crisil and 45 for Icra. Care is also continuing with its liberal dividend policy and has announced 650% dividend during the second quarter, taking the total interim dividend announced in 2014-15 to 710%.

The shares fell to 1,865.5 yen ($17) in the first few minutes of frenzied trading, erasing most of the gains made since the start of the year, in response to Sony's announcement, which came after Japanese  markets had closed Wednesday. The company, whose dual-listed shares slid nearly 7.0 per cent in  New York, blamed the ballooning loss estimate on struggles at its mobile phone business, where it said it would cut staff by 15 per cent, or about 1,000 jobs. Demand for Sony's smartphones has come under increasing pressure from rivals including  Samsung and Apple, which is releasing its newest  iPhone in several key markets, including  Japan, this week. Sony also said it would not pay dividends for the first time since its shares started trading in Tokyo in 1958. The company, whose  credit rating has been slashed to junk, has issued a string of downward earnings revisions over the past two years as it undergoes a sweeping overhaul led by chief executive Kazuo Hirai. The restructuring has included thousands of layoffs, exiting the personal computer business and liquidating assets that saw the $1.0 billion sale of its Manhattan headquarters. News that the company was heading for a 230 billion yen ($2.14 billion) net loss in the fiscal year to March 2015 comes only months after it tipped a shortfall of just 50 billion yen, citing a turnaround in its television unit. The announcement was likely to resurrect fears that what used to be the world's leading electronics company has a lot more work ahead to cast off years of losses. Hirokazu Kabeya, senior strategist at  Daiwa Securities in Tokyo, said the share plunge was inevitable after the firm's latest worrying forecast. \"Market players are getting used to (Sony's downward revisions) but a temporary fall was still unavoidable,\" he said. Sony has been cutting expectations for sales in the money-losing smartphone business amid weaker-than-expected results in emerging markets and the soaring presence of rivals in its home market. \"Other firms are also offering new products with innovative technology -- this business experiences dramatic changes in products and services,\" Hirai told reporters in Tokyo when asked about struggles in the mobile phone unit. \"The environment is changing and becoming more severe,\" he added. Hirai, who took over in 2012, said Wednesday that the firm would continue to focus on more profitable areas of its vast business, which ranges from televisions and portable music to a movie division and little-known insurance business. Despite his bid to slim down the firm, Hirai has repeatedly shrugged off pleas to abandon a money-losing television division, which he insists remains central to Sony's core business. Japanese manufacturers have suffered badly in their TV divisions as razor-thin margins and fierce overseas competition hammered profits. Kabeya at Daiwa Securities said Sony cannot afford to get into a price war with lower-cost rivals, including Chinese smartphone makers, or beat Samsung and  Apple in global market share. \"It is difficult to cut into the dominance of the big two: Samsung and Apple,\" Kabeya said. \"(Sony) would be wise to shift its business resources to where it is strong -- such as movies and music.\" Following Thursday's share price drop, investors may take a step back and see Hirai's efforts to slim down the company as a positive, Kabeya said. \"But it's unlikely we'll see a rapid turnaround and the company will likely continue to go through a difficult time for a while,\" he added.

Spot gold was up 1 percent at $1,206.46 an ounce by 2:23 p.m. EDT (1823 GMT). Flat initially, it gained momentum after a break of technical resistance at $1,196 that triggered automatic buy orders. \"This move is coming during a week when we didn't really have any gold-positive news but ...the way gold is putting up a fight at the moment is potentially giving some confidence to the market,\" Saxo Bank senior manager Ole Hansen said. \"But to make headwinds above the resistance area around $1,225 we need to see some real buying coming in.\" Bullion was still down around 0.3 percent for the week, however, having pulled back from Monday's seven-week high of $1,224.10, reached after last week's weak US employment report. US gold for June delivery settled up 0.9 percent at $1,204.60 an ounce. \"The 100-day moving average should serve as some upside resistance,\" said Matt Bradbard, director at RCM Alternatives, boutique advisory firm in Chicago, referring to spot gold's 100-day moving average at $1,211.69, just above the session high. Gold on Friday shrugged off the impact of a stronger dollar and world equity  markets, which tested record highs. But the longer-term outlook is still bearish, traders said, and prices had surrendered gains after Federal Reserve officials suggested a June rate hike could still be in play. Investors tend to shun gold, which does not pay interest, when market expectations point to US  interest rates rising. Gold could drop to a five-year low of $1,100 this year due to the relative health of the US economy compared to Europe and emerging markets, GFMS analysts at Thomson Reuters said. Gold buying in Asia was slow this week as firmer spot prices turned off buyers, especially in China, and a potentially weak monsoon threatened demand in India. Premiums for physical gold at the Shanghai Gold Exchange stood at a modest $1-$2 an ounce over the global spot  benchmark on Friday.

Strong US refined products futures and data showing a lower US drilling rig count also lent support. Brent May crude rose $1.30 to settle at $57.87 a barrel, finishing above its 50-day moving average of $57.61. US May crude rose 85 cents to settle at $51.64. After a loss last week, Brent rose 5.3 percent. US crude rose 5.0 percent, its fourth consecutive weekly rise. \"The latest agreement with Iran does not open the floodgates for a significant return of Iranian oil on the market as many had feared,\" said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity markets strategy and oil strategy at  BNP Paribas. World powers and Iran announced the interim accord last week. But on Thursday, Iranian leaders said all sanctions on Iran must be lifted on the same day as any final agreement, while the  United States maintains sanctions would be lifted gradually. News this week of unsold Nigerian crude, the biggest jump in US crude oil inventories since 2001 and record Saudi Arabian output in March, limited crude oil's rally. Brent's price has retreated from $115 hit last June, plunging after  OPEC in November decided not to cut output, choosing to defend  market share instead. Crude received support this week from expectations of stronger demand after data from the United States and Germany bolstered the view that world growth is improving. Baker Hughes said the number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States fell by 42 to 760 this week, which also helped to lift oil prices. Producers have responded to oil's steep price drop over the last six months, idling nearly 800 rigs, or 50 percent, since a peak of 1,609 rigs in October. Money managers raised their net long US crude futures and options positions in the week to April 7, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said. Oil rallied even with a stronger  US dollar, which tends to weigh on dollar-denominated commodities. US ultra-low sulfur diesel futures gained more than 2 percent, \"scooping up some support off seasonal agricultural demand and steady export trade,\" said Jim Ritterbusch, president at Ritterbusch &amp; Associates.

GE stock jumped 8.5 percent.\"The stock has been under-owned by institutional investors, and that's going to change now,\" said Tom Donino, co-head of equity trading at First New York Securities.The repurchase program, which will be partly funded by $35 billion through money returned from GE Capital, is the second-biggest in history after Apple Inc's $90 billion plan. GE, which had 10.06 billion shares outstanding on Jan. 31, said it expected to reduce that by as much as 20 percent to 8 billion to 8.5 billion by 2018.\n        \n        In all, GE said it planned to shed $275 billion in GE Capital assets. That includes the previously announced spinoff of its Synchrony Financial credit card unit, the real estate transaction announced on Friday, and future sales of commercial lending and consumer banking businesses with assets of about $165 billion.The company plans to keep $90 billion in finance assets directly related to selling its products such as jet engines, medical equipment and power generation and electrical grid gear.GE has forecast earnings of $1.70 to $1.80 per share for this year, including 60 cents from GE Capital, but expects profit to be \u201csubstantially higher\u201d in 2018, executives said on a conference call with analysts. Shrinking GE Capital will reduce earnings by 25 cents per share, they said, but the stock buybacks should offset that impact.The company already had a significant number of inquiries about GE Capital units before Friday\u2019s announcement, said Keith Sherin, the finance unit's chief.\n        \n        Blackstone Group LP and Wells Fargo &amp; Co confirmed that they were buying most of the assets of GE Capital Real Estate for about $23 billion.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This is the biggest deal in the commercial property market since Blackstone's acquisition of office landlord Equity Office Properties Trust in 2007 for $39 billion, including debt.FOCUS ON INDUSTRIALThe moves announced on Friday will dramatically reduce GE\u2019s exposure to lending and other financial businesses.GE Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt told investors the company would try to generate 90 percent of its profits from industrial operations by 2018. He had previously forecast that share would grow to 75 percent by 2016 from 55 percent in 2013.\u201cWe just think the market timing is very good vis-a-vis the value of financial service assets,\u201d Immelt said in an interview. \u201cThere have been moments in the past when there weren\u2019t a lot of buyers. Now there are.\u201d Immelt and other GE executives said they planned to spend $3 billion to $5 billion a year on industrial acquisitions.GE said it could return up to $90 billion to investors through a combination of dividends, the $50 billion in share buybacks, and completion of the Synchrony spinoff planned for late this year.\tExecutives gave several reasons for GE's accelerated retreat from financial businesses. One is that since the financial crisis, it has become more difficult for GE to fund its lending operations.GE funded many of its loans and leases by borrowing money from bond markets. During the financial crisis it lost access to that funding, bringing it uncomfortably close to running out of cash. Lenders like GE Capital and CIT Group Inc, which cannot rely on bank deposits to fund their assets, have had to rethink the way they do business since the crisis. Many decided to either shed assets or become banks.GE Capital\u2019s size and the potential risks in its lending portfolio made it subject to government regulation as a systemically important financial institution. GE said it would apply to escape that oversight in 2016 as it reduces the financial business' size. GE said it would take after-tax charges of about $16 billion for the restructuring in the first quarter, of which about $12 billion would be non-cash.Shares of GE were sluggish for the past year despite previous moves to reposition itself around the industrial businesses. Still, Friday\u2019s more dramatic move away from finance caught some analysts by surprise.\"What we did not expect was the speed with which management would move to undertake this transformation,\" Sanford Bernstein analyst Steven Winoker wrote. \"We view today's announcement as an overwhelming positive for the company.\"During the conference call, Barclays analyst Scott Davis told executives that while he had been a critic, \u201cthis is good stuff ... I guess you can keep your jobs a little longer.\"JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co and Centerview Partners provided general financial advice to GE, while Bank of America Corp and Kimberlite Advisors advised on the real estate deal.

They declined to be identified since the matter is private. A merger with peers such as Germany's Siemens or France's Alstom could also be considered, one of the sources said, pointing to a tie-up between China's biggest train makers CNR and CSR Corp last year that put pressure on rivals to gain scale.Bombardier's transport arm provides rail vehicles, signaling and control equipment. The sources said the discussions are in early stages and Bombardier may delay any action until potential buyers such as Alstom and Hitachi have finished wrapping up recent transactions.Quebec Economy Minister Jacques Daoust told Reuters he had been assured by Bombardier's controlling family in a telephone call on Friday that the Montreal-based company would not sell the transportation division entirely and that other options were on the table.The discussions come as Bombardier's aircraft business battles with overruns in cost and development for its new CSeries jet, which has sent the firm's stock down 38 percent this year.   Bombardier shares jumped as much as 7 percent on the Reuters report, before retreating to close at $2.64 on the Toronto stock exchange, still up 1.5 percent from the previous day.Bombardier spokeswoman Isabelle Rondeau noted that the company has previously said it is interested in \"participating in consolidation\" and that many options were on the table. \"We're in no rush to do anything,\" she said. \"We will act in a diligent and smart way to make sure that whatever we do will create value for our shareholders.In February, the company suspended dividends, replaced its chief executive, took on new long-term debt and said it would issue new shares to shore up its finances.Bombardier has more than $9 billion of long-term debt, according to documents from its most recent bond deal. Its market capitalization is about C$5.89 billion ($4.66 billion), giving it an enterprise value of about $13.7 billion.POTENTIAL BUYERS BUSY?Banking sources expect consolidation in the industry to continue as the sector remains fragmented.Bombardier's transportation arm saw earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of $486 million in 2014, down 3.7 percent from 2013.The unit could appeal to rivals such as Siemens, Alstom, Hitachi or General Electric, the sources said. There was no immediate comment from the four companies. Siemens and Alstom might face antitrust issues because of their dominant positions in Germany and France, said the sources.Alstom is also currently busy with the 12.4 billion euro sale of its power equipment business to GE, and is unlikely to embark on a new deal before that is completed, said the sources.Japan's Hitachi is also tied up after agreeing in February to acquire the rail business of Italian group Finmeccanica for 1.9 billion euros.    China's CNR and CSR Corp are not expected to seek further expansion in the near future. GE separately said on Friday it will shed most of its finance unit to focus on its industrial business.

U.S. stock index futures were mixed.Lower crude oil prices and a buoyant dollar have dampened price pressures, leaving inflation running well below the Fed's 2 percent target. Officials at the central bank, some of whom have shown a willingness to consider a rate hike at the June policy-setting meeting, view the low inflation environment as transitory. But the combination of low inflation and weak economic growth in the first quarter has prompted many economists to push back their rate hike expectations to later in the year.And some economists believe monetary policy tightening will only begin in 2016. The Fed has kept its key short-term interest rate near zero since December 2008.Crude oil prices have lost more than half their value since June on fears of a global oil glut and the refusal of Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members to cut output.At the same time, the dollar has gained about 12 percent against the currencies of the main U.S. trading partners. Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimates the strong dollar will cut about half a percentage point off both economic growth and inflation in 2015.Last month, imported petroleum prices rose 0.8 percent after jumping 5.2 percent in February. Import prices excluding petroleum fell 0.4 percent in March. They had dropped 0.3 percent in February. Imported food prices fell 1.1 percent after being unchanged in February. The report also showed export prices edged up 0.1 percent last month, the first increase since July, after slipping 0.2 percent in February.

They also show that Nakaso, who rarely speaks in public, shares Kuroda's conviction that Japan is on track to hit the bank's 2 percent inflation target in about a year from now.The BOJ is under pressure to cut its forecast that inflation will hit 2 percent within the current fiscal year at a twice-yearly review of its projections on April 30, due to the impact of falling oil prices.But while acknowledging that inflation was moving away from the BOJ's target, Nakaso said there were clear improvements in inflation expectations such as the rising number of firms promising wage hikes, including for temporary workers.\"We're seeing some positive changes in corporate and household behavior that rarely happened when Japan was mired in deflation,\" Nakaso said.\"That's evidence that Japan is shaking off its deflationary mindset.\"The BOJ now expects core consumer inflation to hit 1.0 percent in the year to March 2016, roughly triple the pace estimated by private analysts.GREECE A RISKNakaso became deputy governor when Kuroda took the helm in 2013 and deployed his \"quantitative and qualitative easing\" (QQE) program - a radical monetary experiment aimed at getting inflation to 2 percent in roughly two years.Nakaso said he saw no need to alter the BOJ's pledge to hit 2 percent inflation \"at the earliest possible time with a time horizon of about two years\" as having that target will help in its efforts to stimulate the economy. \"We have no intention of changing this commitment,\" he said.The BOJ argues the two-year time frame is not a rigid deadline but a broader commitment with room for maneuver.Nakaso, an expert on market operations, said he was mindful of the need to ensure the BOJ's massive purchases do not dry up liquidity in the bond market.But there is so far no sign of severe market distortions or excessive risk-taking spurred by QQE, he said, brushing aside concerns held by some board members that the cost of the stimulus was outweighing the benefits.\"I don't think we'll face a situation where our purchases will be interrupted,\" he said, suggesting that the BOJ still had room to top up bond purchases if it were to expand QQE again.The BOJ now holds nearly a quarter of Japan's government bond market as it buys up almost all the bonds sold by the government each month, raising concerns it was crowding out private investors.Its aggressive purchases also mean its balance sheet is now equal to the size of Australia's economy, making an exit from QQE increasingly challenging.Nakaso, who played a key role in ending the BOJ's previous quantitative easing in 2006, was quiet on how the bank might end QQE, saying only that it had tools available to withdraw stimulus when needed.While his conviction of achieving the BOJ's price target appeared unwavering, Nakaso warned events overseas - notably the unfolding crisis in Greece - could disrupt the positive momentum building in Japan's economy.\"Deposits continue to be withdrawn from Greek banks and the government's financing looks pretty tight,\" he said.\"If Greece exits from the euro, even if accidentally, this could cause market turmoil and repercussions for Japan's economy,\" said Nakaso.Such worries and other duties keep him at the BOJ's headquarters almost round the clock.The soft-spoken 61-year-old confirmed his well-known reputation as a workaholic, admitting that he couldn't think of anything he does besides work on a weekend.\"I don't have a particular hobby. I'll think of something once Japan exits deflation.\" (Additional reporting by Stanley White and Yoshifumi Takemoto; Editing by Rachel Armstrong)","pubdate":"Fri, 10 Apr 2015 15:57:21 +0530","newspaper":"Reuters"},{"title":"Stocks surge: Nikkei tops 20,000, Europe hits 15-year high","content":"","pubdate":"Fri, 10 Apr 2015 14:54:13 +0530","newspaper":"Reuters"},{"title":"Fresh Ivy league post-graduates can't be analysts in India","content":"","pubdate":"Sat, 11 Apr 2015 00:58:00 +0530","newspaper":"Business Standard"},{"title":"Indian market rebound 5% from March lows","content":"&#13;\n         &#13;\n    &#13;\nThe Indian market has seen a dramatic five per cent rebound from its recent lows of two weeks before.\u00a0 The recovery, triggered by value buying, has been supported by passage of key government bills by Parliament and easing of worries on an interest rate increase by the US Federal Reserve.&#13;\nThe Indian market has seen a dramatic five per cent rebound from its recent lows of two weeks before.\u00a0 The recovery, triggered by value buying, has been supported by passage of key government bills by Parliament and easing of worries on an interest rate increase by the US Federal Reserve.The benchmark Sensex has gained from 27,457.6 at the close of March 26 to 28,879.38 on Friday.

The building blocks of reforms are being laid, albeit at a slower pace than what some of the enthusiasts would like,\u201d said Bodke.Analysts said the market direction could be guided by corporate earnings, which will begin next week with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), the country\u2019s most valuable company, announcing its numbers on Thursday.\u201cThere isn\u2019t much expected from India Inc from the March quarter.

These also provide for terms of appointment and capital requirement for trustees and make it mandatory for the trustees to provide a summary term sheet.The term sheet would include disclosures on originators, issuer, trustee, transaction structure, key pool features and credit enhancement and would help enhance the confidence of investors in securitisation transactions.Securitisation involves creating a financial instrument by pooling together illiquid assets and then selling them to investors as securities.Under the new norms, a trustee would need to have a net worth of at least Rs 2 crore, at least two employees with minimum five years of experience in securitisation and with required professional qualification, among other conditions.A trustee will have to supervise the implementation of the covenants regarding creation of security for the securitised debt instruments, resolve the grievances of investors and protect their interest, ensure sufficient funds for payout to investors and conduct regular due diligence on assets, etc.Under the new norms, the trustee would call for periodic reports, supervise the implementation of conditions regarding creation of security for securitised debt instruments and take steps to ensure protection of investors as well as resolve their grievances.Besides, they would have to appoint a compliance officer for performing duties, including monitoring compliance of the various rules and redress of investor grievances.The trustees need to ensure on a continuous basis that the trust property is adequately available at all times to pay the securitised debt instrument holders.As per a code of conduct for the trustees, they are required to avoid possible conflict of interest.","pubdate":"Fri, 10 Apr 2015 23:49:00 +0530","newspaper":"Business Standard"},{"title":"Cotton Corp to float global tender to sell procured stock","content":"&#13;\n         &#13;\n    &#13;\nSitting on a record-high inventory of around 25 per cent of India\u2019s total annual output, government-owned Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) plans a global tender to invite buyers.&#13;\nSitting on a record-high inventory of around 25 per cent of India\u2019s total annual output, government-owned Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) plans a global tender to invite buyers.Initially, to test the market, tenders will be for 5,000-10,000 bales (a bale = 170 kg) by this month-end. If it goes through, it could float another, with an overall target to sell 30,000 bales this cotton year (October 2014\u2013September 2015).CCI has procured 9.1 million bales this year so far at the government's minimum support price, surpassing the previous record of 8.9 mn in 2008-09. Almost the entire procurement operation for this year is done.\u201cWe have spoken with a number of buyers in Bangladesh who were keen on purchase of Indian cotton,\u201d said B K Mishra, chairman and managing director.CCI is also in talks with buyers in Vietnam. Our usual buyer, China, has slowed its purchase of cotton and yarn, to discourage its power and labour-intensive textile industry. A recent Edelweiss Financial Services report estimates China\u2019s cotton import at a five-year low of 1.6 million tonnes (mt) so far this season, against 3.08 mt the previous year.Bangladesh\u2019s cotton import has hit a five-year high of 0.99 mt in 2014-15, compared to 0.89 mt last year. Vietnam has imported 28 per cent more fibre this year at 0.89 mt, as compared to 0.69 mt last year.Despite China\u2019s absence from active buying, prices in both the domestic and international markets have shot up, with the benchmark No 2 cotton for near-month delivery on the InterContinental Exchange quoted at US cents 66.22\/lb, compared to 59.89\/lb in early February. Similarly, the benchmark Shankar-6 variety was sold at Rs 9,420 a quintal in the spot market here on Friday, as against Rs 8,548 a qtl on February 1.&#13;\n\t&#13;\nHome industry\u2019s demand&#13;\nThe textile industry has urged CCI to start releasing cotton into the market, to ease supply. \u201cThe industry is passing through a serious situation due to non-availability of cotton in abundant quantity, on account of the stop-go policy of CCI, in spite of holding a high level of stock. Of its total procurement, CCI has only released 0.3 million bales. It is releasing a negligible quantity of between 3,000 and 5,000 bales a day. This is only resulting in a steep rise in prices, beside creating a shortage of good-quality cotton for the textile sector, which in turn is adversely affecting the export of yarn, fabrics and made-ups. CCI should start releasing at least 50,000 bales a day for 100 days, through e-auction,\u201d said R K Dalmia, chairman of the Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council.Added Prem Malik, chairman of the Confederation of Indian Textile Industry, \u201cOur spinning industry is suffering due to weak demand for cotton yarn from both domestic and international markets. Unless immediate measures are taken to avoid a speculative increase in cotton prices, the spinning industry will suffer irreparable damage.\u201dFor disposal of procured cotton in the home markets, however, CCI is waiting for directions from the Union textiles ministry.","pubdate":"Fri, 10 Apr 2015 23:48:00 +0530","newspaper":"Business Standard"},{"title":"NSEL-FTIL merger: Govt introduces share swap arrangement","content":"&#13;\n         &#13;\n    &#13;\n\t&#13;\n\tThe government on Friday introduced a share swap arrangement for the proposed merger between National Spot Exchange Limited (NSEL) and Financial Technologies (India) Limited.According to the assessment order, made public on Friday, the government has proposed that three fully paid-up equity shares of Rs 2 each will be given in the new entity in return for every eight shares of Rs 10 each in NSEL.The share swap will be done only once the central government takes a decision on the merger. A case has already been filed by FTIL at the high court (HC) in Mumbai against the merger. The draft order was made on October 21 last year, to merge NSEL with FTIL in the public interest, under Section 396 of the Companies Act, 1956. This was in the wake of the Rs 5,574 crore payment fraud at NSEL, in which FTIL holds a 99.99 per cent stake.The government, in its assessment order, has analysed share prices of NSEL and FTIL and came to a fair value of Rs 77 a share and Rs 208 a share, respectively. FTIL is a listed company with a paid-up share capital of Rs 9,21,57,074, divided into 4,60,78,537 equity shares with a face value of Rs 2 each.

Of these 45 mn shares in NSEL, the government has proposed to cancel 4,49,99,895 shares now held by FTIL.Earlier, the government was given a deadline of April 6 by the HC to issue a final order on the merger. However, the government sought three months more to review 19,000-odd objections from FTIL shareholders and related parties before passing an order. The HC had directed the government on February 4 to consider all objections before doing so.The government has also filed a case before the Company Law Board for removal and supersession of the FTIL board, to allow the government to appoint its own nominees in their place, to \u201cprevent further acts of fraud, misfeasance, breach of trust\u201d.","pubdate":"Fri, 10 Apr 2015 23:46:00 +0530","newspaper":"Business Standard"},{"title":"Markets end flat amid narrow trade; Idea Cellular up 4%, RComm jumps 13%","content":"","pubdate":"Fri, 10 Apr 2015 15:53:00 +0530","newspaper":"Business Standard"},{"title":"Markets snap five-day winning streak","content":"&#13;\n         &#13;\n    &#13;\nMarkets snapped five-day winning streak weighed down by profit taking in private banking majors&#13;\nMarkets snapped five-day winning streak weighed down by profit taking in private banking majorsThe 30-share Sensex provisionally ended down 51 points at 28,835 and the 50-share Nifty slipped 11 points at 8,767.&#13;\n____________________&#13;\n(Updated at 2:45PM)The broader markets outperformed the benchmark indices even as telecom shares rallied despite industry regulator announcing ceiling on tariffs on roaming.At 2:45PM, the 30-share Sensex was down 42 points at 28,884 and the 50-share Nifty slipped 13 points at 8,766.Further, the government will announced Index of Industrial Production for February after market hours later today.Meanwhile, global rating agency Fitch said that performance of state-owned banks would remain weak for a while even as the pace of non-performing assets has eased at some large banks.

Indeed, if the trend continues, we could well buy more than 30,000 electric vehicles this year alone.But the good news is also the bad: The government's \u00a35,000 subsidy on each new car will run out when a total of 50,000 have been sold - and that target could now be reached before the end of the year.

Then there were just six; now there are 27 models which qualify for the government grant.The network of charging points has also expanded. There are now 3,000 places in the UK where you can plug in, and by doing so take advantage of motoring costs as low as 2p a mile.\"It's a classic rolling boulder,\" says Jim Holder, the editor of What Car? magazine.\"More manufacturers have come in, the infrastructure has grown, and there are a lot of incentives behind buying a car.\"Those incentives have been key: Road tax exemption, free entry to London's congestion zone, and the fact that the government currently pays  as much as \u00a35,000 towards the cost of a car - the plug-in grant. Company car tax rates are also much lower (see below).But beware. By my calculations, based on government and the SMMT figures, 31,000 plug-in grants have now been paid - leaving another 19,000 before the scheme ends.Given that we bought 8,500 eligible cars in the first three months of 2015, the grants may well run out by the Autumn.  If you're thinking of going electric, it may pay you to put your foot down.The scheme is due to be reviewed in May, but as yet no one knows whether the subsidy will be extended.\n                        Larry Wood believes customers will still buy electric cars, even without the subsidy\n                    \n                Car taxAt his show-room in north London, car dealer Larry Wood, of Hummingbird Motors, is unperturbed. The main reason is that Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV - a plug-in hybrid SUV - has proved so popular.It is now Britain's best-selling electric car, with more than 10,000 sales in the last year. He believes customers won't stop buying them, even if the plug-in grant is no longer available.\"If that does run out in the future, I still think people will buy these cars, but it just makes them \u00a35,000 cheaper,\" he says.In any case, some of his best customers are businesses, for whom the capital cost is not the only consideration. The main attraction for them is a lower rate of car tax. While the most polluting cars pay 35% in company car tax, electric cars - even though they used to be exempt - pay 5%.As a result, any business with a fleet of vehicles could still save thousands of pounds a year by going electric.TechnologyMost of the problems initially associated with electric vehicles are gradually being resolved, or so the industry would have you believe.\"Range anxiety\" - the fear of running out of charge - does not apply if you buy a hybrid car, which switches to its conventional engine as soon as the battery runs out of power.Nevertheless, those who drive pure electric cars still worry about getting stranded. \"Range anxiety will never go away,\" says Jim Holder.But ranges are being extended. Whereas a maximum range of 100 miles used to be typical, the latest cars offer well over that. General Motors hopes that its Bolt model, currently on the drawing board, will have a 200 mile range.The super-expensive Tesla S - already on sale in the UK - will go for 310 miles without a charge, according to the manufacturer.Another problem has been the cost of batteries, the main reason that electric cars are so pricey in the first place.But advances in technology could make them cost-competitive with petrol engines in less than a decade, according to two Swedish scientists.\n                        Tesla's fast-charge station in Maidstone, Kent\n                    \n                'Ferrari'Time spent charging has been another bugbear of electric motorists - if you can find a charge point of course.The government boasts there are now 7,000 in the UK, in 3,000 locations. 500 of those are \"fast chargers\", which can offer a 50% charge in as little as 20 minutes.But in reality, most charging stops are going to be for at least half an hour.And for motorists, understanding the rival charge point networks - and the different costs for using them - still requires some tenacity.Public subsidies for infrastructure have also changed, with the government ending its specific grant of up to \u00a37,500 per charge point.However, there is still some support available for owners under the Electric Vehicle Homecharge Scheme, which pays householders up to \u00a3700 to have a charge point installed at home.What is undeniable is that the appeal of the cars themselves has certainly improved.Where once electric cars looked like garden shed conversions, the designers of BMW and Porsche have now worked magic.Performance too has improved significantly. \"You now get instant torque away from the traffic lights,\" says Jim Holder. \"Frankly, not even a Ferrari will beat you off the line.\"\n    ","pubdate":"Sat, 11 Apr 2015 02:32:14 +0530","newspaper":"BBC"},{"title":"Kurdistan's budget battle with Baghdad","content":"\n                        A Kurdish Peshmerga fighter standing guard on the frontline, 25 miles (40km) south of Erbil\n                    \n                In Iraqi Kurdistan, the Kurds' battle with Islamic State has been complicated by the halving of global oil prices over the past year and a dispute with the central government in Baghdad that has seen the region's revenues dry up. Many in Kurdistan have not been paid for months.Commander Faridon Jwanroyi holds up his AK-47 rifle and fires off a few rounds, purely for my benefit. \"I wish there was Islamic State here, I could fire at them!\" he jokes. I would have asked for a more dramatic display, but the Peshmerga - the Kurdish fighting force here - are a bit short on weaponry. In fact they're a bit short on ammunition, too. And since December, they've even run out of money to pay their soldiers.\"Some haven't been paid in three months,\" he confides, when we met in late March. \"It's hard. They have to pay for their rent, for the children's clothes. But still, we fight on. We have belief.\" Weaker oil pricesBut with talk now of a combined Iraqi-Kurdish operation to liberate Iraq's second city, Mosul, it is an open question whether belief alone can bring victory. Indeed, a financial crisis has been brewing for several months. The halving of the global oil price - undercutting Kurdistan's main source of revenue - and the effect of the war have both had a deleterious effect, especially after fighting in August saw the black flags of Islamic State (IS) come just 19 miles (30km) from Erbil, the capital of the Kurdish autonomous region in northern Iraq.\"When IS is at the door, logically it's hard to convince foreign investors that Erbil's safe and nothing's wrong,\" says Govan Haji Akravi, chief executive of Fastnet, an internet systems provider for foreign companies in the city. \"Almost from one day to another, many of them packed up and left.\" \n                        Some Kurdish fighters have not been paid for three months, says their commander, Faridon Jwanroyi\n                    \n                \n                        Islamic State fighters came within 19 miles (30km) of the regional capital Erbil last summer\n                    \n                Displaced peopleThere's also been a major refugee crisis. Some one-and-a-half million displaced people have arrived in Kurdistan, fleeing the fighting in Syria and northern Iraq. That's a 30% increase in the population of the region, leading to huge extra stresses, I'm told, on local services like water and education. The refugees are mostly housed in improvised camps. One of the more bizarre is the Ankawa Mall - a half-built shopping centre on the outskirts of Erbil. Like many building projects, it was abandoned by its developer as the crisis hit last year. Now the raw concrete shell is occupied by some 4,000 Iraqi Christians from the Mosul region, sleeping in alcoves created for designer boutiques. A makeshift wickerwork crucifix hangs over the entrance. One of the refugees, Issa, charges about 30 cents for a haircut and shave in his makeshift barber's shop in the main atrium at the foot of two massive escalators that are now derailed and disintegrating. \"I'm cheaper than the Kurdish barbers here,\" he tells me. \"No one wants to look hairy like the guys from Islamic State, so they come to me!\" he laughs. But the smile quickly fades. Life in the shopping centre is miserable, he says: \"It's like a camp for chickens.\" He dreams of escaping to Europe.    \n                        About 1.5 million refugees have fled to Kurdistan\n                    \n                \n                        The population of the region has risen by 30%\n                    \n                \n                        \"No one wants to look hairy like the guys from Islamic State,\" says Issa, a barber in one of the refugee camps\n                    \n                Dispute with BaghdadPerhaps the biggest economic challenge for Kurdistan stems from its troubled relations with central government. For the last year, Baghdad has only fitfully been paying the regional government in Erbil its share of the national budget. Under the constitution, Baghdad requires the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) to share its own oil production with the rest of the country. The Kurds should then be reimbursed with 17% of the total nationwide budget, which is currently set at $105bn (\u00a371bn).  Baghdad has accused Erbil of selling oil illegally, without its authority, and of failing to meet production quotas - allegations the Kurds deny. \"Baghdad knows very well we are selling oil - we have to pay people's salaries,\" says Dr Ali Sindi, the KRG's minister of planning. \"Meanwhile five million Iraqi citizens have been cut off from their rightful share of the nation's resources. This is a threat to the stability and the sustainability of the region,\" he says.The anger in Kurdistan is all the greater since Baghdad is continuing to pay salaries to government workers living under Islamic State. Even some refugees - civil servants displaced from Mosul - are, it is said, receiving their salaries from within the camps, whilst some of those caring for them haven't been paid since December.In the last three weeks, Baghdad has announced a breakthrough, saying it is renewing budget payments, although so far these amount to less than half what is owed for just March alone. Salaries for most workers, including soldiers, remain many months in arrears. The Iraqi Prime Minister, Haider Al-Abadi, has been quoted as blaming delays on a wider economic crisis in Baghdad. \n                        Under Iraq's constitution, the Kurds have to share their own oil output with the rest of the country\n                    \n                \n                        Kurdistan should be getting $105bn (\u00a371bn) from the central government in Baghdad\n                    \n                'We don't give up'\"If we don't reach a lasting solution, we will have to handle it through our own export of oil,\" says Dr Sindi. Kurdistan is this month said to be completing a new pipeline to its northern neighbour, Turkey. But despite the threats, few in Erbil believe Kurdistan has the political power to cut its own deals with the wider world.  In the meantime, some state employees are getting desperate. Civil servant Najad Amin and his wife Iqbal say they expect the last of their savings to run out in the next month. They've started growing vegetables in their back garden, to help feed the family. Do they blame the politicians in Baghdad or in Erbil, I ask?\"They're all to blame,\" they say. \"But we Kurds are used to depending on ourselves. We will find a way. We don't give up, absolutely.\" \n    ","pubdate":"Fri, 10 Apr 2015 04:45:26 +0530","newspaper":"BBC"},{"title":"Cybersecurity v human rights in Africa","content":"\n                        As internet usage rises in Africa, so does cybercrime\n                    \n                Think cybercrime and Africa, and most people in the developed world think of the notorious 419 email scam.This involves gangs extorting money from the likes of great aunt Mabel by promising her riches, if she'll just send some cash and\/or her bank details to a nice man in Nigeria. But cybercrime on the continent has moved far beyond this, with gangs embracing more sophisticated ways to use technology, such as malware and botnets, to get what they want.Internet usage is rising rapidly in Africa, and with it, cybercrime.This growth is making it easier than ever for criminals to operate. And it has created a new pool of potential victims lacking the knowledge and experience to be able to protect themselves effectively.VictimsSecurity expert Kaspersky says more than 49 million cyber-attacks took place on the continent in the first quarter of last year, with most occurring in Algeria, ahead of Egypt, South Africa and Kenya.But cybercrime is actually most pervasive in South Africa, with security firm Norton saying 70% of South Africans have fallen victim to cybercrime, compared with 50% globally.McAfee, another cybersecurity firm, reported that cybercrime cost South African companies more than $500m (\u00a3340m) last year.\n                        In South Africa 70% of people have been victims of cybercrime, says Norton\n                    \n                Baby stepsAfrica has long lacked a legal framework for tackling cybercrime.But in June 2014, the African Union (AU) approved a convention on cybersecurity and data protection that could see many countries enact personal protection laws for the first time.For it to be implemented, however, 15 of the 54 AU member states will need to ratify the text. As yet, not one country has done so, though there is optimism it will happen in the next three-to-five years. \"Cybersecurity is a growing concern for the nations of the African Union as more people come online,\" says Drew Mitnick, junior policy counsel at human rights organisation Access, which has called on member states to ratify the convention as soon as possible.\"It is critical for the countries to adopt cybersecurity policies that better protect users while respecting their privacy and other human rights.\" \n                        The African Union (AU) is made up of 54 member states - only Morocco doesn't belong\n                    \n                Access believes the AU should lead these efforts. The group has tracked proposed cyber and data protection laws in Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritania, Morocco, Tanzania, Tunisia and Uganda. In each case, the legislation would either fail to provide basic protection for user data, or allow the government to violate the rights of privacy, expression, and assembly, Access believes.But Beza Belayneh, managing director of the African Cyber Risk Institute (ACRI), says there are positives.\"[The convention] is a jumpstart for many countries who do not have any legal ground or appreciation to combat cybercrime,\" he says.\"It is a good guide to develop... computer or cybersecurity laws in a localised manner. It is the best way just to start the job. It has to start somewhere.\"It is apparent that many, if not all, African countries lack the capabilities to defend their ever-growing cyber infrastructure.\"Cybersecurity is finally receiving the attention it deserves, he added.Ducks in a rowAs a guide to helping African nations get their \"cyber ducks in order\", as Mr Belayneh puts it, the AU convention isn't too bad. Mr Mitnick says the convention contains a data protection provision covering control of personal data, with a large part of it mirroring the data protection framework and language developed by the European Union.He also commends the protection of human rights. \"The text requires governments to uphold the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, along with other basic rights such as \"freedom of expression, the right to privacy, and the right to a fair hearing, among others,\" he says.\"The inclusion of privacy is most welcome, considering it is not explicitly found in the African Charter.\"\n                        The AU proposals include giving judges unlimited power to issue search and seizure warrants on data or computers - causing understandable concern about human rights\n                    \n                'Negative effects'However, there are real concerns about some of the provisions. The Centre for Intellectual Property and Information Technology Law at Strathmore University, Kenya, is against implementation in its current form.It believes the convention could limit freedom of expression and allow authorities to intercept private data too easily. Judges would be given unlimited power to issue search and seizure warrants on data or computers, for example.All this could have \"substantial negative effects on online economies and social cultures across Africa,\" it says.\n                        A woman uses a tablet at an internet cafe in Dakar, Senegal\n                    \n                Mr Belayneh agrees that the document gives too much power to judges and law enforcement arms of governments, and says it fails to take into account the roles of education and consultation in combating cybercrime.\"It was written by lawyers,\" he says. \"Cybersecurity and cybercrime need a multi-sectoral approach - cybersecurity educators, researchers, NGOs [non-governmental organisations], vendors, ethical hackers were supposed to be involved so they could present a multi-dimensional framework instead of legal paper.\"\n                        Does criminalising \"insulting language\" allow governments to clamp down on dissent?\n                    \n                Some of the convention's phrases seem to be in direct conflict with protecting human rights. For instance, while the convention limits the processing of personal data, it contains an exception for a task \"carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority\" - a loophole ripe for abuse, some experts believe.Mr Mitnick says the convention could also pave the way for harsh criminal convictions. \"In one example, it limits the use of insulting language, which could describe a significant portion of the language on the internet and is likely to lead to subjective prosecutions,\" he says.Though the experts believe the convention is satisfactory as a first step, the negatives are certainly clear for all to see. \n    ","pubdate":"Fri, 10 Apr 2015 04:48:55 +0530","newspaper":"BBC"},{"title":"Offshore profit slump","content":"Recovery from recession includes at least three pay-out bonuses for those who own the capital. Competitors have been closed down or taken over. Assets are going cheaply for those feeling acquisitive. And workers are poorly placed to push for higher wages.So it's no great surprise, after such a long downturn, that profitability is doing rather well. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has just published figures showing as much.At net return on capital of 11.9% last year, UK plc (excluding the finance sector) is at its most profitable this century, and comparable numbers don't go much further back than that. That was a rise from the 9.7% low point for profitability in 2009.The ONS breaks down profitability figures by sector, and the service sector looks particularly strong. Its net profitability was at 16.7% during last year. It peaked in the third quarter at 18.4%.Exploration risksBut the sector that has most to worry about is the UK Continental Shelf. That is, the offshore oil and gas industry.This should be no great surprise to those who have watched the price of Brent crude fall in recent months. But the evidence is described by industry group Oil and Gas UK as \"shocking\".At 10.4% net rate of return in the final quarter of 2014, it doesn't look too bad by comparison with other sectors. But the oil and gas sector thrives on big profits, for which it pays heavily in tax and without which it doesn't take the necessary exploration risks. \nEven if the price rose above $100 per barrel, it is argued, that wouldn't be enough without tackling costs \nThis is also an industry which deploys its capital where it can get the best return. And Oil and Gas UK's Malcolm Webb points out that the UK is now at the bottom of the league table for profitability.The ONS figures show that offshore profitability halved from the first quarter of last year to the last. And the final quarter hadn't yet seen the worst of the oil price fall.Offshore firms registered a 15.7% net rate of return for the whole year - by far the lowest level since the ONS data began. Of the previous 13 years this century, profitability only fell below 30% on three other occasions, and was above 40% in 2008 and 2011.Having secured what it wanted from the UK Budget in tax cuts, the industry is now looking for cost cuts of at least 40% per unit produced, making the argument that that scale of change is necessary to secure a sustainable future.  Even if the price rose above $100 per barrel, it is argued, that wouldn't be enough without tackling costs (as I write, it's trading at $56.64).And of course, cost cutting means a challenge to the workforce, with the threat of strikes hanging over the industry as it pushes for changes to pay and conditions.\"No guarantees\"With assets priced attractively, the Royal Dutch Shell deal to buy BG Group for \u00a347bn is seen as a sign of more consolidation to come.Shell has more than 2,000 people based in Aberdeen, and has already shed 250 jobs this year. BG has 1,500 between its North Sea operations and its Reading headquarters. Shell chief executive Ben van Beurden said the company would be taking a \"hard look\" at its development programme and that there would also be savings from \"manpower\" across the company, though the \"why and where\" remained to be worked out.He added that Shell's commitment to the North Sea was \"unchanged going forward\", while it plans to invest \u00a34bn in the UK between 2016 and 2018. But he added: \"There are no guarantees in life. We will have to look at how we make the North Sea strong and healthy again.\"Of the 20 countries where BG operates, the UK is its biggest for output, representing a sixth of the 600,000 barrels per day (or gas equivalent) that it pumped last year. That reflects its history as a nationalised company, which was split from British Gas in 1987.But BG's appeal to Shell is not in the UK. It's in less mature basins and deep water and it's a wide spread of interests. After the UK, the main production centres are Kazakhstan, Brazil, Trinidad and Tobago, Australia, Thailand and Egypt.According to analysts at Wood Mackenzie in Edinburgh, Brazil is one of the big attractions. The returns are relatively attractive there. Ten years from now, including BG, 13% of Shell's production will be from Brazil. It will have the advantage of dominating the deepwater offshore sector.That's if it gets regulatory approval. It needs that in the EU, Brazil, China and Australia, and Brazil could prove difficult, given the scale of the Shell and BG tie-up.However, the BBC's business correspondent in Sao Paolo, Daniel Gallas, has reported today that there are interesting moves afoot that could open up the country to a lot more foreign investment.The Brasilia government has sought to control the scale of foreign investment by demanding partnership with state-owned Petrobras. Not only does that require a lot of government capital, but also Petrobras is deeply mired in a corruption scandal. Only when that has been resolved, through 'Operation Carwash', will the position of foreign companies become clearer.Cooking with gasThe other big attraction to Shell of its BG acquisition is in Liquefied Natural Gas, or LNG. That's proving ever more attractive as a means of avoiding dependence on Russian gas, opening up supply from parts of the world where pipelines are not practical, and it helps reduce coal burning in power stations which helps meet emissions targets. There's been significant investment in the LNG fleet and port facilities to grow that market.Shell and BG together will be the world's biggest LNG player. According to Wood Mackenzie: \"Shell will have unrivalled flexibility and exposure to virtually every major LNG supply source and market, providing significant scope for portfolio optimisation. The move re-energises Shell's LNG development pipeline, adding a leading US position, entry to East Africa, and new options to expand in Australia and Canada\".Having made the first move in this anticipated consolidation, the expanded Shell has the advantage of being first mover, even though it paid a very high premium over BG's recent share price.

A domicile is usually the country his or her father considered his permanent home when he or she was born, or it may be the place overseas where somebody has moved to with no intention of returning.That means somebody can be born, be educated and work in the UK but still hold non-dom status. It also means that some may inherit their non-dom status from their parents.For proof to the tax authority, they have to provide evidence about their background, lifestyle and future intentions, such as where they own property or intend to be buried.Key to non-dom tax status is that an individual must pay UK tax on UK earnings, but need not pay UK tax on foreign income or gains unless they bring that income back to the UK.Has this system been around for a while?Yes, for more than 200 years.The FT says it was originally introduced in 1799 and allowed people with foreign property to shelter it from wartime taxes.It became a regular point of debate during and after the financial crisis when the legal tax affairs of wealthy residents was put under the spotlight.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPolicy guide: Taxation\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tThis election issue includes income tax and national insurance levies and business taxes.\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\tHow many non-doms are there?This is where things become a little more opaque.People do not necessarily have to indicate their domicile status on their UK tax return. The UK tax authority believes there was a general trend of rising numbers to 2008 when charges came in, but a fall since.There were an estimated 114,800 non-doms in 2012-13, according to the latest figures available.Non-doms have included some super-wealthy household names, but also include some foreign doctors and nurses working for the NHS, as well as some students.What tax charges do non-doms face?Non-doms who have lived in the UK for seven of the last nine years must pay \u00a330,000 each year to maintain their tax status.Those living in the UK for 12 of the last 14 years must pay \u00a350,000 to do so.Non-doms living in the UK for 17 of the last 20 years must pay \u00a390,000 to keep their non-dom status.About 5,000 people pay these charges, raising an estimated \u00a3300m this year for the Treasury.Some other countries have similar regimes, but the seven-year period of grace is unusual internationally.What would scrapping non-dom status mean?There would still be a period of time where temporary workers and students can legally maintain their domicile overseas.However, the big questions raised by effectively scrapping non-dom status include:Whether there will be a flight of non-doms who paid an estimated \u00a36.2bn in UK tax in 2012-13\nHow much can be raised in UK taxes if former non-doms decide to stay?\nWill that tax income outstrip the amount raised from non-dom charges? Labour says it would do so by several hundred million pounds but this is very difficult to quantify\nWhat will be the effect on jobs and business creation in the UK?\nWhether this will create a more even playing field among entrepreneurs irrespective of their domicile\nThe debate is likely to continue whichever party wins the election.","pubdate":"Wed, 08 Apr 2015 18:42:52 +0530","newspaper":"BBC"},{"title":"Funding an art renaissance in the US","content":"US art museums took a knock in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and attendances continue to fall. But some major investments and new approaches to fundraising have helped them rebound. On an unseasonably warm day in January, as the price of oil dropped by 50%, a group of Texans gathered at a swanky New York restaurant to present a multi-million dollar plan for the redevelopment of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston.There were a number of jokes about the impact of oil prices on the portion sizes offered by the restaurant - two salad leaves and a pea, however artfully placed on a teaspoon of green mousse and a coin sized piece of fish, do not make a meal in Texas.But there was no joking about the importance of art to Houston's economy, which is fuelled by oil and energy and has been rocked by the plunge in prices.The city hopes the new campus, with its world class collections, international art school and conservation centre, will help attract the type of workers it needs to diversify and sustain future growth.\"Building a green park of two acres in a downtown city - that's meaningless today,\" says Texan pipeline tycoon Rich Kinder, one of the richest men in America with a personal net worth estimated at $11.9bn (\u00a38bn).\"This is a massive extension of the south west's largest museum of fine arts, but it's also much more than that. It's transformational for Houston.\" US Art FundingIndividual philanthropy remains the strongest source of support for art museums in the US. In 2013 museums were given six times as many works of art as they purchased.Endowments, trusts and foundations provide 28% of art museum funding.  The government funds 6% and corporate giving accounts for just 4%.Visitors spend an average of $8 when they go to a museum.Each visitor costs the museum an average of $53 in terms of investment.Figures from the Association of Art Museum DirectorsAlmost all the $350m cost of the project has been met by wealthy individuals, including Mr Kinder, who is chairman of the museum's board of trustees. He donated $50m. Due to be completed by 2019, the museum campus is expected to generate $334m in economic activity over 20 years. That's in line with a new report from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), a government grant-making agency, which says arts and culture contribute almost $700bn to the US economy, outperforming the construction industry. The sector also employs some 4.7 million workers, and for every 100 jobs created by demand for the arts, 62 jobs are created in other areas.On the downside, the report also shows that museum, gallery and theatre attendances are continuing to fall. According to the NEA, the vast majority of Americans \"consume\" the arts online and only 21% actually visit art museums.  \"But we do ourselves a disservice when we look at only one measure of engagement with the arts,\" says NEA chairman Jane Chu. \"Our reports show that the arts are a formidable presence in America and the ways in which people participate are expanding.\"\n                        Baltimore Museum of Art uses special events to encourage children to visit\n                    \n                She says technology provides an early entry point to the arts which may peak interest in live performances and trips to museums. But institutions need to find new ways to engage with audiences and become more relevant to their communities, she adds.\"Museums were founded years ago on the idea that they were treasure troves or libraries of objects. Today they have to be destinations for people to have experiences that they can create and be a part of,\" says Doreen Bolger, director of the Baltimore Museum of Art in Maryland.The museum has an international reputation and holds the largest collection of works by Henri Matisse. It is supported by a $100m endowment that enables it to offer art making days for local families, outreach programs for city schools, and interactive mobile phone tours for visitors. In 2006 it introduced free admission.'Financially stable'\"We were of course affected by the 2008 downturn because all of our diverse [revenue] sources were affected. But our trustees and donors have been truly astounding. \"Our funding from them was sustained throughout the downturn and many people increased their giving when the museum went free. They felt it was important to provide that for the community,\" says Ms Bolger.Endowments remain the most significant source of museum revenue, but new figures from the Association of Art Museum Directors (AAMD) show that funding has become more diversified.Admission fees play a relatively small part, but memberships, foundations and trusts, store purchases and local government funding make important contributions. Corporate donations have fallen.\"Museum attendance dropped off in 2008 and some museums underwent some staffing cuts, cut back a little on programming. They did what they needed to do to weather the storm,\" says AAMD director Christine Anagnos.\"But they're [now] financially stable because they receive their money from a variety of sources,\" she says.\"They're not just relying on one source, whether it's endowment income or earned revenue or corporate memberships. They are really diversified in their revenue streams.\"Oil dependenceIronically, Houston was sheltered from the worst effects of the financial crisis because of its dependence of oil. But today that dependence is making it vulnerable.\n                        Baltimore Museum of Art says community relevance is vital for survival.\n                    \n                \"People will tell you that Houston is not nearly as wedded to energy as it was a generation ago,\" says Rich Kinder.\"We have the largest medical centre in the world, a tremendous port and a number of universities. But [the falling price of oil] still has a definite impact and will have an impact on philanthropic giving.\"But Gary Tinterow, the director of Houston's Museum of Fine Arts, says he doesn't expect any dramatic decline in donations, and philanthropy remains a better bet than public funding.\"There is something very satisfying and secure when you have government support. You know what your budget is each year and you move forward. But as we've seen with the recent downturn, sometimes massive cuts are necessary in order to fill the mandates from the government.\"The Obama administration has proposed a $2m increase to funding for the NEA next year, bringing the total to $148m. The advocacy group Americans for the Arts says that won't meet the needs of the 95,000 non-profit arts organisations and local agencies the NEA helps support.But the good news is that donations to the arts were up by almost 8% in 2013, according to the latest figures from Indiana University, which tracks charitable giving. The total, $16.66bn, is now touching pre-recession levels.Even if Americans don't go to museums as much as they used to, they clearly think the arts are important enough to support.\n    ","pubdate":"Wed, 08 Apr 2015 05:05:22 +0530","newspaper":"BBC"},{"title":"Latin America's wake-up call on global school tests","content":"\n                        Chile is the top-performing Latin American country in both OECD and Unesco school tests\n                    \n                There have been concerns that the quality of education has been stagnant in too many countries across Latin America.This is a major problem in a globalised economy, where rewards go to the most highly-skilled and most productive workers, and where there is more importance than ever attached to high-quality education.But how do we measure the quality of education in Latin America against global standards if there is an unwillingness to take part in international tests? How can would-be reformers compare results across international borders?Among the most widely recognised international comparisons are the Pisa tests - the Programme for International Student Assessment - conducted every three years by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).In Latin America, the regional rankings of these international tests taken by 15 year olds in maths, reading and science, are headed by diminutive Chile, ahead of economic powerhouses like Brazil and Mexico.But most countries remain off the ranking completely.Missing the testsPart of the reluctance for many Latin American countries might be a fear of being compared with world leaders in education like Finland and Japan. Even Chile, the highest ranking country in the region, is considerably below the global average for these tests, with the average in the Pisa tests being countries such as the UK and France.Latin America: Countries in Pisa testsChile\n51st (out of 65 countries and regional education systems)\nMexico\n53rd\nUruguay\n55th\nCosta Rica\n56th\nBrazil\n58th\nArgentina\n59th\nColombia\n62nd\nPeru\n65th\nSource: OECD\n\nBut the Pisa exam has also generated significant controversy over its methodology and design, leading to concerns - common to many standardised tests - that it does not adequately measure the quality of instruction. Or that it does not truly capture the diversity of contexts facing such different school systems.These concerns are reflected in the fact that fewer than half of Latin American countries currently participate.But there are other tests that can provide a global scale for measurement. Unesco's Third Regional Comparative and Explanatory Study (TERCE) covers a much larger part of the region. This has evaluated 15 countries, including Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, and Colombia, as well as smaller participants such as Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala, the Dominican Republic and Uruguay. \n                        Unesco's tests measure pupils in countries such as Guatemala against international standards\n                    \n                The assessment also has a broader range than Pisa, looking at children at different stages of development (at the ages of eight and 11), and evaluating the context of each school.What TERCE found was reason for cautious optimism - but also renewed effort. Its comparison between its last evaluation in 2006 and today showed a modest but broad improvement in test results across the majority of Latin American countries. These rankings were also headed by Chile, followed by Costa Rica and Uruguay. But they also allowed a comparison with countries missing from the Pisa tests, such as Guatemala and Paraguay, which appear in the lower half of the TERCE test scores.Falling behindBut despite - or even because of - the surrounding controversy, these tests have already served an important purpose. Whatever their flaws, they have brought attention to the fact that the massive expansion of access to education in the region, a major victory in itself, isn't sufficient without an equal improvement in quality. \n                        Uphill struggle: Peru is at the bottom of the Pisa rankings, but midway on the Unesco scale\n                    \n                No longer can policymakers ignore the reality that even Latin America's best performing countries, much less its average ones, are far behind the developed world, and far behind where they need to be to compete in the global economy. A student from Honduras or Paraguay is competing for jobs with graduates in Singapore and South Korea.

Latin America's education systems spend nearly as much as the OECD average, with some spending as much as 6% of GDP, while producing lacklustre results.More funding is in some cases necessary, but without a rigorous and targeted approach to ensure that it is spent well, the extra money may just be wasted.That's why a new conversation is needed in Latin America, one that focuses on innovative ways to improve quality - and quickly.A wave of new participants - social entrepreneurs, private businesses, investment funds, foundations, and advocacy groups - are taking the lead in introducing new pedagogies, new technologies, and structural reforms in their education systems.And projects like Pisa and TERCE are helping to put these issues front and centre on the public policy agenda.The next generation of students has little time to lose.

Most are tourists looking up in awe at the LED screens that dominate the landscape.  Nobody notices the tiny dark figure 350 feet above the pavement clinging to the side of the century old Times Building, home of the New Year's Eve Ball.Jeff Rolfe is a cross between Spider Man and Guy Fawkes, gingerly making his way up and down the side of the building with a bitter winter wind attacking him from every angle as he dangles. In his arms are pre-configured wooden racks full of small explosives. He has to install enough to put smiles on a billion TV viewers worldwide. Thankfully these are the finishing touches to a display of fireworks that in just over 24 hours will hopefully also elicit oohs and aahs from a million New Years Eve revellers in the Square. \n                        Jeff Rolfe on top of One Times Square\n                    \n                Short but sweetFor almost everyone the thrill of fireworks is an experience that can be traced back to childhood. Yet if you were able to time travel backwards two, three or four decades into history and stand once again in front of your local town display, you would likely be  disappointed. Mr Rolfe, from Fireworks By Santore, says few people realise that fountains, rockets, wheels and bursts have all taken a huge step forward thanks to technology.\"The shows used to be much much longer, over an hour in duration. But attention spans are shorter now,\" he says.\"Today, 30 minutes is considered a very long display. Technicians used to manually shoot big shells from steel tube mortars that would need to cool down before the next ones could be fired. It was more relaxed. Now we shoot multiple smaller shells per second from several locations, remotely.\"\n                        Fireworks are something most of us learn to love as children. This group is celebrating July 4th in 1940 with sparklers\n                    \n                \n                        The fireworks at the closing ceremony of the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984 might leave modern audiences slightly underwhelmed\n                    \n                Songs were played in their entirety rather than the mixed snippets that are favoured today. And any notion of syncing the beats to the bursts was usually a happy accident rather than anything pre-planned.New software and hardware means shells and cannons can be fired remotely up to two miles away and timed to within 1\/100th of a second. And in a world full of giant LEDs, laser beams and light shows, fireworks are frequently asked to become team players, which is why \"syncing\" is one of the most sought after skills in the industry.\"Using computer software, we mark where we want the highs and lows of the display to be in relation to the music,\" says Mr Rolfe. \"And then we backtrack all the timings, and create digital cues alongside the music track for the firing sequence in an FSK (Frequency Shift Keying) file. When you hear it, it sounds like the noise made by an old modem.\"\n                        The fireworks business has always been dangerous - these men are making fireworks by hand for King George V's coronation celebrations in 1911\n                    \n                \n                        Health and safety has come a long way since 1929, when these women were pictured in France\n                    \n                Like clockworkBig events, especially those on live TV are usually produced using \"timecode\".  A highly accurate digital clock signal is generated from a central source and every person, computer, device and camera at the event uses it as their only time reference. Music tracks, lighting and fireworks can be pre-programmed digitally to flow together perfectly.But it can take months of work by specialist designers to produce a dazzling display. One thing on their side is that the chemical compounds have become more sophisticated.  The colours are brighter, the variety of effects has greatly increased and there is far less residual smoke that once might have blocked subsequent bursts.\n                        Fireworks have become ubiquitous at sporting events - here during the opening ceremony for the 2015 Cricket World Cup in New Zealand\n                    \n                Fireworks today are so chemically precise and stable, a horizontal rocket with a label that says 60 feet will shoot off a building straight out exactly 60 feet, and predictably reach its peak explosion right at the end of that distance without letting gravity pull it down prematurely. Of course timecode and technology are not always perfect, and when things go wrong the motto invented for the digital age - \"all or nothing\" definitely applies. Perhaps the most famous incident was the 2012 Big Bay Boom display in San Diego, which saw about 18 minutes worth of fireworks explode in just 15 seconds thanks to a timecode issue. It could have been the most expensive fireworks display ever (on a per second basis). But firework displays that often cost cities as much as a teacher's annual salary have an upside - successful or not.Officials in San Diego worked out their firework display fiasco still generated about $10m in revenue from local restaurants, tourism, boat hires, and hotel stays. And accidents don't happen as much these days. The biggest problem with older displays was explosions due to sparks from other fireworks in the display. Now the devices are smaller and more spread out so it doesn't happen as often.\n                        Accidents at modern events are now rare - this traditional display however is created by throwing molten metal against a cold wall in Nuanquan, Hebei province, China to celebrate the Spring Festival\n                    \n                Corporate communicationsCorporate requests often drive the direction of the fireworks industry. Companies are increasingly asking for daytime fireworks which have been around for years, but now look much better because once again there are brighter colours and cleverer chemical combinations which make them more dramatic against a bright blue backdrop.\n                        Flogos are created using a portable bubble container, and allow you to create airborne company logos\n                    \n                Despite the many developments one request that is harder than you'd think is to reproduce corporate logos. Mr Rolfe acknowledges that static logos are easy to do. But firing words and exact shapes from the ground into the sky with 100% accuracy for the entire audience to read from different vantage points is an art form that's in its infancy. \"We are just starting to work with it.

AstraZeneca could reach out to Pfizer after three months and Pfizer could take another run at its smaller British rival in six months time, whether it is invited back or not.Pfizer's move came two hours before a 5.00 pm (1200 ET) deadline to make a firm offer or walk away, under UK takeover rules. Its decision to quit the stage, at least for now, had been widely expected after AstraZeneca refused its final offer of 55 pounds a share.\"Following the AstraZeneca board's rejection of the proposal, Pfizer announces that it does not intend to make an offer for AstraZeneca,\" Pfizer said in a short news release.The biggest U.S. drugmaker promised it would not go hostile by taking its offer directly to AstraZeneca shareholders, leaving the fate of what would have been the world's largest ever drugs merger in the hands of its target, whose board would have had to make a complete U-turn to get a deal done.\"We continue to believe that our final proposal was compelling and represented full value for AstraZeneca based on the information that was available to us,\" said Ian Read, Pfizer's chairman and chief executive.Pfizer's final offer was at a price that many analysts and investors had previously suggested would bring AstraZeneca to the table for serious negotiations.\n        \n        But in rejecting an earlier offer of 53.50 pounds as undervaluing the company, the British group indicated it needed a bid more than 10 percent higher, or at least 58.85 pounds per share, for its board to consider a recommendation.Pfizer had urged AstraZeneca shareholders to agitate for engagement and several expressed disappointment at its intransigence, although others - encouraged by AstraZeneca's promising drug pipeline - backed the firm's standalone strategy.AstraZeneca Chairman Leif Johansson welcomed Pfizer's decision to back down, which he said would allow the British company to focus on its growth potential as an independent company.What happens next will depend upon whether AstraZeneca's share price deteriorates in the coming weeks and how hard its shareholders push for it to revisit a deal with Pfizer.BlackRock, AstraZeneca's biggest shareholder, backed the board's rejection of Pfizer's 55 pounds a share offer, but urged it to talk again in the future.POLITICAL OPPOSITIONThe proposed transaction ran into fierce opposition from politicians in Britain, Sweden - where AstraZeneca has half it roots - and the United States over the likelihood that the marriage would lead to thousands of job cuts.Ultimately, it was price and the lack of room for eleventh-hour maneuvering by Pfizer that killed the deal.Pfizer had several reasons for taking aim at AstraZeneca for what would have been its fourth mega-merger in 14 years.Highest on the list appeared to be Pfizer's desire to take part in a recent trend of so-called tax inversions, under which it could reincorporate in Britain and pay significantly lower corporate tax. Pfizer would also be able to use tens of billions of dollars it has parked overseas, avoiding high U.S. taxes for repatriating the huge cash pile.Pfizer also had its eye on a promising portfolio of drugs in AstraZeneca's developmental pipeline, especially several potentially lucrative cancer medicines.It was this pipeline that AstraZeneca management used to make its case for Pfizer significantly undervaluing the company.Chief Executive Pascal Soriot went as far as making a 10-year forecast for a 75 percent rise in sales by 2023.\"As we said from the start, the pursuit of this transaction was a potential enhancement to our existing strategy,\" Pfizer's Read said. \"We will continue our focus on the execution of our plans, bringing forth new treatments to meet patients' needs and remaining responsible stewards of our shareholders' capital.\"The merger would have restored Pfizer as the world's largest drugmaker by sales, a position it relinquished to Swiss-based Novartis when billions of dollars in annual revenue evaporated after its top-selling cholesterol fighter Lipitor began facing generic competition in 2011.(Editing by David Evans and Mark Potter)","pubdate":"Mon, 26 May 2014 21:25:17 +0530","newspaper":"Reuters"},{"title":"See you later? Slim Pfizer deal hopes prop up AstraZeneca","content":"\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Pfizer's (PFE.N) chances of striking a deal to buy AstraZeneca (AZN.L) in the coming days look vanishingly small, but the notion it could return later this year is propping up the British drugmaker's shares.\nThe stock rose 3 percent on Wednesday, despite AstraZeneca insisting on Tuesday there wasn't the slightest chance of Pfizer's $118 billion offer being increased by a May 26 deadline set by UK takeover rules.While Pfizer agrees it cannot raise its final offer of 55 pounds a share, its advisers have been urging investors to speak up against AstraZeneca's decision to reject its proposal, according to several people familiar with the matter.One suggestion now circulating is that disgruntled AstraZeneca shareholders could call an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) to put Pfizer's offer to a vote. The support of just 5 percent of shareholders is needed to call such a meeting.Even if shareholders wanted to revive the bid - or oust the board - an EGM would not come in time to rescue the current process before the takeover rules deadline, but they could force AstraZeneca to open communications with Pfizer in late August, after a compulsory three-month cooling-off period.\"Some of the more active hedge funds, instead of selling out are buying in,\" said one hedge fund investor. \"There has been sufficient shareholder dissatisfaction about this deal that investors can use that to get a favourable outcome further down the road.\"The only way a deal could be salvaged this month would be for AstraZeneca Chairman Leif Johansson and his board to make a complete U-turn and recommend Pfizer's current 55-pound offer, which looks out of the question.More leading shareholders spoke out publicly on the deal on Wednesday, but they didn't speak with one voice, underlining the challenge facing the Pfizer camp in trying to stir an investor rebellion.\n        \n        Threadneedle Asset Management came out in support of AstraZeneca's stance, while investment and insurance group AXA said the board should not have prevented Pfizer's offer being put to investors.The AXA view was echoed by Legal &amp; General, according to the Wall Street Journal. An L&amp;G spokesman confirmed to Reuters that the fund manager had talked to both companies but declined to comment further.EVENLY BALANCEDTo date, investors representing around 10 percent of AstraZeneca's share base have spoken out against the board's decision, with a similar number broadly lending their support, according to Thomson Reuters data.At more than 44 pounds, the shares remain well short of Pfizer's offer but a fair way above the undisturbed price of 37.82 pounds seen before news of Pfizer's interest emerged in mid-April.A recent run of favourable clinical trial news about AstraZeneca's new drugs has also supported the stock, with UBS issuing a note on Wednesday setting a price target for the shares of 50 pounds, without a Pfizer deal.Analysts at Barclays, who have a 40 pounds target, said in a note that the market was pricing in a probability of around 15 percent that there would eventually be an agreed deal with Pfizer valuing AstraZeneca at some 60 pounds.The U.S. company's ambitions to create the world's largest drugmaker - and slash its tax bill in the process - appeared within reach at one point in talks between the two sides last weekend, with AstraZeneca indicating a desired price of 58.85 pounds.But AstraZeneca's Johansson told Reuters on Monday that Pfizer had closed down discussions after a telephone call lasting more than an hour on Sunday and had surprised AstraZeneca by issuing its final offer later that night.(Reporting by Ben Hirschler; Editing by Will Waterman)","pubdate":"Wed, 21 May 2014 23:53:11 +0530","newspaper":"Reuters"},{"title":"AstraZeneca rejects Pfizer's take-it-or-leave-it offer","content":"\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Britain's AstraZeneca on Monday rejected a sweetened and \"final\" offer from Pfizer, puncturing the U.S. drugmaker's plan for a merger to create the world's biggest pharmaceuticals group.\nThe rebuff came nine hours after Pfizer said on Sunday night it had raised its takeover offer to 55 pounds a share, or around 70 billion pounds ($118 billion) in total, and would walk away if AstraZeneca did not accept it.The rejection left some major shareholders fuming as shares in AstraZeneca slumped 11 percent to close at 42.88 pounds after falling as much as 15 percent - their biggest ever intra-day decline. Pfizer rose 1 percent in New York.AstraZeneca Chairman Leif Johansson told Reuters he now saw no prospect of a deal with Pfizer before a deadline of May 26 set under British takeover rules, or any likelihood of that deadline being extended.Experts also said Pfizer had left itself no room to return with a last-minute higher offer due to the strict takeover code.Pfizer wants to create the world's largest drugs firm, with a headquarters in New York but a tax base in Britain, where corporate tax rates are lower than in the United States. The plan has met entrenched opposition from AstraZeneca, as well as politicians and scientists who fear cuts to jobs and research.\"It died of multiple wounds. Too little cash, too many suspicions about Pfizer's motives, and too little confidence in its assurances about jobs,\" said Erik Gordon, professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. \"Pfizer's chances are going down, despite its offer of a higher price.\"Johansson said he had made clear in discussions with Pfizer that his board could only recommend a bid that was more than 10 percent above an offer of 53.50 pounds made by Pfizer on Friday, which would amount to at least 58.85 pounds. He blamed Pfizer for calling a halt to discussions after a telephone call lasting more than an hour with Pfizer's chairman and CEO Ian Read on Sunday afternoon.\n        \n        In addition to the inadequate price, Johansson also slammed what he said was a lack of industrial logic behind Pfizer's move; the risks posed to shareholders by the controversial tax plans; and the threat to life science jobs in Britain, Sweden and the United States.\"Pfizer's approach throughout its pursuit of AstraZeneca appears to have been fundamentally driven by the corporate financial benefits to its shareholders of cost savings and tax minimization,\" Johansson said in a statement.\"From our first meeting in January to our latest discussion yesterday, and in the numerous phone calls in between, Pfizer has failed to make a compelling strategic, business or value case.\"But many of Johansson's shareholders were deeply unimpressed. \"We do not think the Astra management have done a good job on behalf of shareholders,\" said one fund manager at a top-10 investor in the group.Alastair Gunn of top-30 shareholder Jupiter Fund Management said: \"We are disappointed the board of AstraZeneca has rejected Pfizer's latest offer so categorically. They should have at least engaged in a constructive conversation with Pfizer.\"However, Pfizer's proposed takeover, which would be the largest-ever foreign acquisition of a British company, is opposed by many scientists and politicians who fear it would undermine Britain's science base.The U.S. group said its new offer was final and could not be increased. It said it would not make a hostile offer directly to AstraZeneca shareholders and would only proceed with an offer with the recommendation of the AstraZeneca board.Pfizer had also increased the cash element in its offer to 45 percent, under which AstraZeneca shareholders would get 1.747 shares in the enlarged company for each of their AstraZeneca shares and 24.76 pounds in cash.The new offer represents a 15-percent premium over the current value of a cash-and-share approach made on May 2 - worth 50 pounds a share at the time - which was also swiftly rejected by AstraZeneca.Pfizer's Read said he believed his proposal was \"compelling\" for AstraZeneca shareholders and expressed frustration at its refusal to talk, urging the British company's shareholders to pressure its board to engage.TAKE A BREAKIn the absence of further discussions or an extension of the deadline for making a firm offer under British takeover rules, Pfizer's proposal will expire at 5 p.m. (1600 GMT) on May 26. After that, it would have to wait six months before making another bid.\"AstraZeneca will have six months to demonstrate that it was right to reject Pfizer's offer, or face the prospect of a fresh approach,\" said analyst Mick Cooper at Edison Investment Research.While Pfizer would have to wait on the sidelines until November, it would be possible for AstraZeneca to initiate talks from late August, if it decided it wants coax a higher offer.The latest increased offer had been widely expected. Pfizer said last week it would consider a higher offer as it urged AstraZeneca's board to enter talks.The British firm has laid out details of its pipeline of new drugs and argues it has no need for a deal. However, many analysts believe its projections that it can increase sales by 75 percent to $45 billion a year by 2023 are over-optimistic.There has been a mounting political backlash against the proposed deal in Britain, the United States and Sweden, where AstraZeneca has half its roots.The Swedish government launched a concerted effort on Friday against a merger that it fears will lead to cuts in science jobs and research, echoing concerns aired by British lawmakers at two parliamentary hearings last week, and fears for U.S. jobs in states where AstraZeneca has a large presence.British Prime Minister David Cameron has said he wanted more assurances from Pfizer, in the event of a takeover, although as the head of the free-market Conservative Party he does not want to be seen to be deterring foreign corporate investment.Pfizer gave a five-year commitment to complete AstraZeneca's new research centre in Cambridge, retain a factory in northern England and put a fifth of its research staff in Britain, but added that these pledges could be adjusted if circumstances changed \"significantly\".The tax aspects of the deal, meanwhile, have sparked anger in the United States, where lawmakers are now considering legislation to prevent what are known as corporate inversions, under which U.S. companies re-incorporate overseas to avoid U.S. taxes.Inversions have helped fuel a wave of deals in the pharmaceuticals sector in recent months.

Are you going to get more involved at Newport Beach,\" Speich added, referring to Pimco's California base nearly 6,000 miles from Allianz's Munich headquarters.Three top shareholders told Reuters they want Allianz to rethink the six-person management structure put in place at Pimco after El-Erian's departure and provide greater detail on Pimco's long-term plan to broaden its focus beyond fixed income, among other things.Some shareholders think Gross, known on Wall Street as the Bond King, has been given too much freedom by Allianz, which bought the firm for $3.3 billion in 2000.Historically, Pimco's success has worked wonders for Allianz. In the past decade alone, Pimco's contribution to the German group's operating profit has climbed almost fourfold to 3.2 billion euros ($4.46 billion), representing a third of total core earnings. Allianz now sells nearly two thirds of its investment products to North American clients.Over the past year, however, Gross has shown signs of losing his touch. In a difficult year for bond markets, Gross's flagship Pimco Total Return Fund lost 1.9 percent in 2013, its first annual loss since 1999 and worst performance since 1994, according to Morningstar.Allianz has said little publicly until now about Pimco's performance or the internal disagreements at the fund manager.The insurer's head of investor relations, Oliver Schmidt, said in an interview published on Allianz's website that the company is working to address investor concerns about asset management and the fallout from rock-bottom interest rates.\"We are currently in the midst of extensive discussions with investors regarding both our investment and our product strategy,\" Schmidt said.Investors are also keen to hear plans about Allianz's own management, given that the contracts of six of its 11 board members - including Diekmann - are due to expire at the end of the year.

On a consolidated basis, more than 130 million shares changed hands - 10 times the daily average volume for the last 50 days.The lock-up agreement that expired this week applied to about 470 million shares, or 82 percent of Twitter's equity, held by insiders, venture capitalists and other investors. Twitter allowed one batch of shares to be sold in February, but that lockup governed only about 10 million shares, most of which were held by non-executive employees.\"The move is bigger than expected and is indicative of the negative investor sentiment towards Twitter right now,\" Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell told Reuters.Tuesday's reaction to Twitter's lock-up expiry was in sharp contrast to that of Facebook Inc in late 2012. Facebook shares jumped 13 percent on November 14 that year, when its lock-up expiry of roughly 800 million shares did not trigger an immediate wave of insider selling.Twitter's shares have been trading at all-time lows since April 29, when the company disclosed sagging usage metrics.Indeed, concerns about user growth and engagement levels have wiped out about half of Twitter's market value, more than $18 billion, since late December, even as it has hit revenue targets in the two quarters since it went public at $26 a share.The stock does not look cheap either, despite the declines. Before Tuesday's selloff, Twitter shares were trading at 323 times forward earnings per share, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. Facebook trades at about 39 times.\"I am starting to think that sentiment might have got too negative, but I don't see anything that can turn this around in the near term,\" Cordwell said.The largest holder of Twitter shares, private equity firm Rizvi Traverse, had no intention of selling when the lockup expired, a spokesman for the firm said on Friday.Rizvi Traverse, which owns about 85.2 million Twitter shares, could not be reached for comment on Tuesday.Lowercase Capital, which also holds a significant stake in Twitter, said Monday it had no intention of selling its shares.Twitter co-founders Jack Dorsey and Evan Williams and Chief Executive Dick Costolo said in April they did not plan to sell shares after the restrictions were lifted.Venture capital firm Benchmark, which holds a roughly 6 percent stake, has also said it would not sell its stake.But other major shareholders could see an opportunity to cash out, given that none of Twitter's insiders sold their shares during the initial public offering.Large shareholders include venture capital firms Union Square Ventures and Spark Capital.

It said on Friday that the U.S. firm's latest offer of 50 pounds a share \"substantially\" undervalued the company.The group has not ruled out a deal altogether, however, and people familiar with the matter said it was willing to talk if there were a compelling offer. Several large shareholders have told Reuters they would be open to a deal at a higher level.Shares in AstraZeneca were down 2.7 percent at 46.80 pounds at  11:10 am ET (1510 GMT).\n        \n        \"OVERLY OPTIMISTIC\"Sales are set to fall over the next three years as older medicines lose patent protection, slipping to $24.5 billion by 2016 and $23.6 billion in 2017, according to Thomson Reuters consensus analyst forecasts.AstraZeneca has previously said it disagrees with analysts and sees sales back up at last year's level by 2017. Now it is forecasting \"strong and consistent\" growth from 2017 to 2023, driven by new treatments for cancer, diabetes, heart disease and lung disorders.It also flagged up a possible therapy for Alzheimer's disease, a notoriously high-risk area for drug development.Growth in core earnings per share, which excludes certain items, is expected to exceed revenue growth during this period, it added.Jefferies analysts said the forecasts appeared \"overly optimistic\" but the detailed product breakdown might help raise the price and cash mix in any deal. In addition to a higher bid, AstraZeneca also insists there should be more cash than the 32 percent suggested by Pfizer, with the balance paid in shares.AstraZeneca launched its 10-year sales forecast defense salvo a day after Pfizer CEO Ian Read renewed his call for the British company's board to enter talks.Read insisted his offer was \"compelling\" and signaled he was now weighing all options, including a possible hostile bid or looking at other targets, though he stressed that buying AstraZeneca remained \"Plan A\".Pfizer's pursuit of AstraZeneca has created a political stir in Britain, with critics of the U.S. group's approach fearing that a takeover will lead to big cuts in drug research, despite assurances given by Pfizer to the government.Officials have said a deal would be a commercial matter for the two companies but business minister Vince Cable said Britain could use its powers to assess if a takeover was in the public interest, while lawmakers called on Pfizer's bosses to appear before parliament.CANCER FOCUSMost investor interest centers on AstraZeneca's experimental cancer medicines designed to boost the immune system. Such drugs promise to revolutionize treatment of many tumor types and would also complement Pfizer's line-up of oncology medicines.But AstraZeneca is lagging rivals such as Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, Merck &amp; Co and Roche Holding AG in this field.\"This is a company that has made significant progress in moving its pipeline forward over the last 18 months,\" said Alistair Campbell, an analyst at Berenberg Bank. \"Is it enough on a fundamental basis to justify the current share price?
