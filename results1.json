{"root":[{"title":"Airtel, Idea, RCOM drop on fears of fierce bidding","content":"Biswajit Baruah, ET Bureau Mar 28, 2015, 04.07AM IST(Reflecting the mood, analysts\u2026) MUMBAI: Shares of telecom companies such as Bharti Airtel, Idea Cellular and Reliance Communications (RCOM) dropped more than 5% on Friday on fears of aggressive bidding for airwaves, a development that may exert pressure on companies' balance sheets and cash flow, and restrict their expansion plans. Reflecting the mood, analysts maintained a cautious outlook on the sector, saying fresh buyers should stay away from this space in the near-term. On Friday, the department of telecommunications (DoT) released details of bidders at the recently concluded airwaves auction, where the government mopped up Rs 1.1 lakh crore from the spectrum put up for auction. The prices for the spectrum were considerably higher than the reserve price, said analysts. \"Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular have paid a little more for the spectrum than what the markets were expecting,\" said Mayuresh Joshi, VP, (institutional) Angel Broking. \"Going forward, Reliance Jio's pricing for its services would be closely watched. However, investors should note that the overhang on telecom stocks over spectrum is probably over.\" Telecom stocks came under intense selling pressure on Friday \u2014 Bharti Airtel fell 5.64% to Rs 376. Idea Cellular dropped 4.96% to Rs 171 after touching new 52-week high of Rs 187 in early trade. RCOM touched a new 52-week low of Rs 56.90 before closing at Rs 58.25, down 3.56%, while Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) ended 1.54% lower at Rs 7.68. Shares of some telecom companies \u2014 Bharti Airtel, Idea Cellular \u2014 have had a good run in the past one year, gaining 21% and 23%, respectively, while Reliance Communications dropped 53%; all these stocks have underperformed the ET 100 Index which gained nearly 27% over the same period. \"We reiterate our cautious view on the telecom sector, given the stretched balance sheets, rising capital expenditure, regulatory pushback, Reliance Jio's launch overhang, and expensive valuations,\" said Vinay Jaising, analyst at Morgan Stanley. They are also sceptical of Indian telecom companies due to a number of structural issues such as cannibalisation of voice by data, rapid expansion and network operational cost to deliver data, pricing impact from the imminent entry of Reliance Jio, and stretched balance sheets due to spectrum prices. \"Telcos will further bloat their balance sheet with debt, which is already under severe strain. We maintain 'hold' rating for Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular with a price target of Rs 399 and Rs 167\/share, respectively,\" said Amar Mourya, research analyst at IndiaNivesh. Most telecom companies may report negative free cash flow in 2015 as they are required to pay a quarter of the committed amount in the spectrum auction upfront, and the rest will be paid in installments over 10 years from 2017.","pubdate":"Sat, 28 Mar 2015 04:07:22 +0530","newspaper":"Economic Times"},{"title":"Sustained growth makes Kajaria Ceramics a good long-term bet","content":"Narendra Nathan, ET Bureau Jan 26, 2015, 08.00AM IST(Analysts say Kajaria Ceramics\u2026) We recommended Kajaria Ceramics a year back because of its high growth rate and decent valuations. The company has rewarded its investors by outperforming the benchmark index, Sensex, handsomely during this time. Kajaria Ceramics continues to grow at a fast pace. It has reported a 30 per cent growth in revenue in the third quarter of 2014-15 compared to the same quarter previous year. The net profit jumped 55 per cent because of a 29 per cent increase in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, and a fall in interest cost due to reduction in debt.  Analysts say Kajaria Ceramics will maintain its high growth in the coming years, largely because of conducive industry dynamics. For the past several years, the Indian tiles industry has been growing due to urbanisation, affordability of tiles, and consumers' focus on home aesthetics, aided by rising disposable incomes. This growth rate is expected to accelerate in the coming years because of the new government's increased focus on affordable housing and the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. Going by its performance, Kajaria should be able to beat the industry growth rates. In the next five years, Kajaria Ceramics is aiming to grow its revenue at a compound annual growth rate of 20 per cent. Close to 15 per cent of this growth will come from an increase in volume. The remaining will be a result of an increase in prices and a customer shift to premium brands. Kajaria Ceramics is also expanding capacity. It will be spending up to Rs 200 crore in the next fiscal year towards this purpose. Though the company will continue to focus on its tiles business, which accounts for 90 per cent of its turnover, it has entered the sanitaryware and sanitary-fittings segment. Its sanitaryware plant is already operational and is expected to reach full production by March 2015. Even though margins are expected to remain at the current 15 per cent-plus level, the fall in the natural gas price will bring down costs and should help the entire sector expand margins. The historical PE of 35 may appear high, but analysts say, because of the strong volume growth, pricing power, healthy margins and a strong balance sheet\u2014very low debt, which is being cut further\u2014it is justified. But, bear in mind, the company, and the entire Indian tiles industry, faces a threat from Chinese imports. Any policy shift that serves to boost tiles export from China, will adversely impact the entire industry, including Kajaria.

These companies are unlikely to reap the full impact of the festive season in the December 2014 quarter. The festive sales were split between September and December due to early Navratri and Diwali in 2014. Along summer and an early festive season led to a strong first half for these companies, giving many investors an impression that the demand has bounced back for discretionary products post-election. A base effect, thanks to lower sales in the year-ago period, also boosted the numbers and fuelled sentiment.  There was a growth of 27-57% in sales for the September quarter and 25-39% in the first half of FY15. The earnings growth figures were even higher. The result was a surge in stock prices (See table). But, random checks (while talking to dealers and mall outlets) suggest that the sales in the December quarter have been less than impressive. One spots a similar trend in other consumer discretionary sectors like passenger vehicles and two-wheelers. For instance, Hero Moto reported minus 2% growth YoY for the December quarter, Bajaj Auto recorded minus 1% growth YoY while M&amp;M closed the quarter minus 12% YoY growth. Maruti was an exception, generating a 12% growth YoY. While analysts are justifying current high valuations \u2014 claiming that these companies will benefit from the correction in steel, copper and aluminium prices \u2014 a weak sales growth may keep sentiments sombre.","pubdate":"Tue, 13 Jan 2015 05:14:13 +0530","newspaper":"Economic Times"},{"title":"Balkrishna Industries: A long-term bet after the recent correction","content":"Narendra Nathan, ET Bureau Jan 5, 2015, 08.00AM IST(Balkrishna Industries\u2026) The profits of Balkrishna Industries fell by around 40% after reporting poor numbers in the second quarter of 2014-15. The tyre company's net profit went down by 17% compared to the corresponding period last year and by 22% compared to the preceding quarter. Lower volume from European markets (the region contributes around 50% of its sales volume) and the discounts offered to clients to compensate the fall in natural rubber prices are the primary factors behind the fall in net profit.  Balkrishna Industries could not take advantage of the lower prices of natural rubber in the second quarter because it had a huge inventory of rubber purchased at higher prices. Rising employee costs following partial commissioning of its new tyre plant with 1.5 lakh per annum capacity in Bhuj, Gujarat, was another factor. The recent correction in its price has brought the valuations of Balkrishna Industries to reasonable levels. In addition to the fall in price, analysts are getting bullish on this niche player because of its improving fundamentals. Its Bhuj plant is expected to become fully operational by April 2015. This will help the company to foray into much bigger radial tyres (expected to move up from 35 inches to 57 inches) and, therefore, its tyre portfolio will be more comprehensive. Radial tyres have higher realisations (3-4% higher) and with this new plant, its radial sales volume is expected to move up from around 30% now to above 40% over the next three years. Balkrishna Industries is also working towards increasing its global market share in the off -highway tyres (OHT) from 5% to 8% in the next three years. To realise this goal, the company plans to set up warehouses in the US and other overseas markets in the near future to increase its penetration levels. Though the global fall in agricultural product prices has resulted in less demand for new tractors (lower demand for OEM tyres), existing tractors continue to work (normal demand for tyres in the replacement segment , which is nearly 80% of its total sales volumes). New tractor sales are also expected to improve following the stability in the American farm sector reported recently. With around 90% of its revenues coming from exports, Balkrishna Industries will also benefit from the sudden depreciation of the rupee in the last six months.

Orient Cement's per tonne cement production cost is around 13% lower than the industry average. Therefore, the company could repeat its stellar performance in the third quarter of 2014-15 as well. In its second quarter sales, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) and net profit grew by 20%, 123% and 200%, respectively, compared to the corresponding period last year, or on a year-on-year basis. The company could also improve its third quarter EBITDA per tonne to `785, which is among the highest in the industry. The rise in EBITDA per tonne was due to the strong volume growth (up by 4% y-o-y) and improvement in realisations (up by 15% y-o-y). Orient Cement is a good long-term bet because of the infrastructure growth expected in the company's two key markets\u2014Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh\u2014in the coming years. Industrial demand is expected to pick up in Maharashtra following the initiatives by the new state government. Andhra Pradesh, however, is the best example of the amount of harm political uncertainties can do to even well-established companies. The market size of cement has shrunk to 13 million tonnes in the state from the peak levels of 18 million tonnes in 2008-09. However, due to the low cost of production, Orient Cement could increase its market share.  Cement consumption should jump in Andhra Pradesh in the coming years as massive construction projects are lined up at the new state capital. To benefit from this, the mid-sized cement company is in the process of increasing capacity through green-field and brown-field projects. The company's 3 million tonne green-field project in Gulbarga (northern Karnataka) is progressing smoothly. Its trial production and, subsequently, commercial production is expected from April 2015 and June 2015, respectively. This project also includes a 45MW thermal plant and a 7MW waste-heat-recovery plant. Despite the key advantages, such as low-cost cement production, high return on equity (ROE) and return on capital employed (ROCE), this stock is still attractively priced compared to its peers.

While its net profit rose by 50% year-on-year, it zoomed by 98% on a quarter-on-quarter basis. The rise in net profit was primarily due to two factors: first, there was a 316% y-o-y jump in its other income which was triggered by the profit it made from sale of investments. Second, the company reported 14% y-o-y increase in rating revenues, which was significantly higher than the 5% achieved by its main competitor Crisil during the period under consideration. In addition to the increase in surveillance income, Care also added 761 clients during the quarter and its total volume of debt instruments rated increased by 16% y-o-y.  Analysts are now getting bullish on the long-term (2-3 years) growth opportunities for the credit rating sector because it is best placed to benefit from the cyclical recovery in corporate capex and bank credit growth. The sector is already doing well because of the pickup in debt issuances in the recent past. According to Prime Database, debt placements during the first half of 2014-15 went up by 22% compared to the corresponding period last year. Another factor helping credit rating agencies is the improvement in credit environment. For example, Care's modified credit ratio (MCR) has improved from 1.05 times to 1.25 times in the second quarter, y-o-y. MCR is calculated by dividing the number of rating upgrades with downgrades. An increase in MCR means that the financials of the rated companies are stable and improving. With a turnaround in the economy, MCR is expected to improve further in the second half of 2014-15. With the revival in market sentiments, debt issuances are expected to rise manifold, increasing business opportunities for rating agencies like Care. Since the company provides 'grading' for equity public offerings, revival in stock market sentiments also bodes well for it. While analysts are bullish on the sector, Care is their preferred choice. This is so because it is the cheapest stock based on valuations and the recent correction has brought down its valuations further to reasonable levels. It is quoting at 35 times trailing price-to earnings ratio compared to 51 times for Crisil and 45 for Icra. Care is also continuing with its liberal dividend policy and has announced 650% dividend during the second quarter, taking the total interim dividend announced in 2014-15 to 710%.

The shares fell to 1,865.5 yen ($17) in the first few minutes of frenzied trading, erasing most of the gains made since the start of the year, in response to Sony's announcement, which came after Japanese  markets had closed Wednesday. The company, whose dual-listed shares slid nearly 7.0 per cent in  New York, blamed the ballooning loss estimate on struggles at its mobile phone business, where it said it would cut staff by 15 per cent, or about 1,000 jobs. Demand for Sony's smartphones has come under increasing pressure from rivals including  Samsung and Apple, which is releasing its newest  iPhone in several key markets, including  Japan, this week. Sony also said it would not pay dividends for the first time since its shares started trading in Tokyo in 1958. The company, whose  credit rating has been slashed to junk, has issued a string of downward earnings revisions over the past two years as it undergoes a sweeping overhaul led by chief executive Kazuo Hirai. The restructuring has included thousands of layoffs, exiting the personal computer business and liquidating assets that saw the $1.0 billion sale of its Manhattan headquarters. News that the company was heading for a 230 billion yen ($2.14 billion) net loss in the fiscal year to March 2015 comes only months after it tipped a shortfall of just 50 billion yen, citing a turnaround in its television unit. The announcement was likely to resurrect fears that what used to be the world's leading electronics company has a lot more work ahead to cast off years of losses. Hirokazu Kabeya, senior strategist at  Daiwa Securities in Tokyo, said the share plunge was inevitable after the firm's latest worrying forecast. \"Market players are getting used to (Sony's downward revisions) but a temporary fall was still unavoidable,\" he said. Sony has been cutting expectations for sales in the money-losing smartphone business amid weaker-than-expected results in emerging markets and the soaring presence of rivals in its home market. \"Other firms are also offering new products with innovative technology -- this business experiences dramatic changes in products and services,\" Hirai told reporters in Tokyo when asked about struggles in the mobile phone unit. \"The environment is changing and becoming more severe,\" he added. Hirai, who took over in 2012, said Wednesday that the firm would continue to focus on more profitable areas of its vast business, which ranges from televisions and portable music to a movie division and little-known insurance business. Despite his bid to slim down the firm, Hirai has repeatedly shrugged off pleas to abandon a money-losing television division, which he insists remains central to Sony's core business. Japanese manufacturers have suffered badly in their TV divisions as razor-thin margins and fierce overseas competition hammered profits. Kabeya at Daiwa Securities said Sony cannot afford to get into a price war with lower-cost rivals, including Chinese smartphone makers, or beat Samsung and  Apple in global market share. \"It is difficult to cut into the dominance of the big two: Samsung and Apple,\" Kabeya said. \"(Sony) would be wise to shift its business resources to where it is strong -- such as movies and music.\" Following Thursday's share price drop, investors may take a step back and see Hirai's efforts to slim down the company as a positive, Kabeya said. \"But it's unlikely we'll see a rapid turnaround and the company will likely continue to go through a difficult time for a while,\" he added.

Bullion has surrendered gains inspired by a weak US employment report last week as  Federal Reserve officials suggest a US rate hike in June could still be in play, lifting the dollar to three-week highs versus a basket of major currencies. Spot gold was steady at $1,194.51 an ounce by 0225 GMT, after hitting a session low of $1,192.30 on Thursday. Bullion is down 1.3 percent so far this week after pulling back from Monday's seven-week top of $1,224.10. US gold for June delivery was nearly flat at $1,194.40 an ounce. \"What is changing rapidly is people's expectations as the actual rate hike timing approaches,\" said Mark To, head of research at Hong Kong's Wing Fung Financial Group, who believes the Fed is on track to raise rates in June. Data on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits rose less than expected last week and the four-week moving average of claims hit its lowest level since 2000, suggesting an abrupt slowdown in job growth in March was likely a fluke. Investors tend to shun gold, which doesn't pay interest, when market expectations point to US interest rates rising. \"But whether the Fed raises rates in June or decides to wait till September is a moot point in our view since we think that once the first rate hike takes place, the Fed will likely stand aside for a period of time to see what the repercussions of its move will be,\" INTL FCStone  analyst Edward Meir said in a note. Gold could drop to a five-year low of $1,100 this year, before a recovery in 2016 spurred by Asian demand, GFMS analysts at  Thomson Reuters said. Demand from India and China, the world's top two gold consumers, has been slack so far this year, with Beijing's anti-corruption drive hurting Chinese appetite. Premium for physical gold at the Shanghai Gold Exchange stayed at just about a dollar over the global spot benchmark on Friday.

Brent crude rallied 4 percent intraday as European equities strengthened on German industrial output and trade data and Greece's repayment of a loan to the International Monetary Fund. Also supportive was Iran saying it will only sign a final nuclear accord if all sanctions imposed over its disputed nuclear program are lifted the same day. \"The German data provided some lift early because it comes even before the expected economic boost from central bank quantitative easing and any sign that an agreement with Iran isn't going to get done is bullish,\" said  Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. Dollar-denominated oil pared gains on the strong dollar, which was driven higher by sentiment that US  interest rates inevitably will rise. Brent May crude rose $1.02 to settle at $56.57 a barrel, having reached $58.02. US May crude rose 37 cents to settle at $50.79, after hitting $52.07. US crude's Tuesday close near $54 was the strongest since Dec. 30. \"The dollar's strength helped pull crude off the highs and the big jump in inventories is still a factor,\" said Gene McGillian, senior analyst at  Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. Government data on Wednesday showed US crude inventories surged 10.95 million barrels to a record 482.4 million last week, the biggest weekly gain in 14 years. News late Tuesday that Saudi Arabia's production rose to 10.3 million barrels a day (bpd) in March also sparked Wednesday's tumble. An adviser to Saudi  oil minister  Ali al-Naimi struck a hopeful note on Thursday, saying that this price slide was temporary and that global oil demand was expected to grow annually by up to 1 million bpd. Iranian oil minister  Bijan Zanganeh said in  Beijing on Thursday that  OPEC would \"coordinate\" to accommodate Iran's return to oil markets without causing a price crash. OPEC's strategy of holding output steady is not working and members should discuss production levels before June's meeting, Zanganeh said. OPEC's ability to coordinate will be under scrutiny as the situation in Yemen and other conflicts in the region keep relations between Iran and  Saudi Arabia tense.

Athens has until the end of the month to reach an agreement, with an April 24 meeting of eurozone finance ministers seen as the last chance for a deal. Despite making the payment, Greek  Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis remained typically defiant. \"We are not going to sign on the bottom line of whatever you're giving us just to get the (money),\" Varoufakis said on a visit to Paris. \"We are not promising anything just to get the next loan tranche,\" he added. From Moscow, where he is on a two-day official visit, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras called for an \"honourable compromise\" to ensure continued access to the European Union-International Monetary Fund bailout cash. \"I am confident that despite the difficulties, all the forces will come to an honourable compromise,\" Tsipras said. Athens had earlier authorised the loan repayment to the IMF after days of uncertainty. \"Yes, I've got my money back,\" IMF head  Christine Lagarde replied when asked at an Atlantic Council think tank event in Washington whether Athens had made the payment. \"What matters is now for the Greek authorities and the three institutions, the IMF, the ECB ( European Central Bank) and the  European Commission, to get on with the work,\" she said later on CNBC. Tsipras' decision to go on a Russia charm offensive -- while his government is locked in loan talks with its EU peers -- has irritated Greece's European partners. Athens is trying to persuade the EU and IMF to continue lending it money while easing austerity requirements in order to boost economic growth. After talks with President  Vladimir Putin on Wednesday, Tsipras also met Russian Prime Minister  Dmitry Medvedev on Thursday. Speaking to students in Moscow, Tsipras said his priority remained to reach a deal with the EU. \"The goal of the government is for Greece to remain in the euro. To remain in the eurozone. We consider this problem facing us a common European problem and for this reason we seek a joint European solution,\" the 40-year-old prime minister said. Experts from the IMF and the EU are scrutinising a list of economic reforms proposed by Athens in a bid to unlock another 7.2 billion euros in loans to stave off possible bankruptcy. The Greek government has insisted it can meet its payments, but Tsipras himself fuelled market fears when he warned German Chancellor  Angela Merkel in a letter last month that Athens would not be able to service its debt without more financial help from the EU. Later this month, Athens has to make interest payments of nearly 400 million euros and roll over 2.4 billion euros in six- and three-month treasury bills due to mature on April 14 and 17. Athens on Wednesday raised 1.14 billion euros in six-month treasury bills. On Thursday it announced the sale of another 625 million euros in three-month bills next week. Greek banks are dependent on the ECB for financing, but the eurozone's central bank no longer accepts Greek sovereign bonds as collateral for loans. The ECB on Thursday raised its emergency liquidity assistance to Greek banks by 1.2 billion euros to 73.2 billion euros. Since 2010, Athens has received two successive loan packages from the EU and the IMF worth up to a total 240 billion euros in exchange for tough austerity measures and sweeping economic reforms. In a sign of attempts by the new Greek government to make good on promises to ease the pain of austerity, parliament began Thursday considering the reinstatement of about 4,000 sacked state employees, ranging from police officers to bureaucrats. Putin and Tsipras exchanged warm words on Wednesday and a vague \"joint action plan\" on cooperation was agreed upon, but Putin insisted Athens had not asked for financial aid. Greece has been particularly hard-hit by the embargo slapped down last year in retaliation for sanctions imposed by the bloc against Moscow, as more than 40 percent of its exports to Russia were farm products. Although the embargo will remain, there was a sign of a potential compromise in the shape of a proposal to set up joint Russian-Greek companies based in Russia that would provide a loophole in the ban, according to a government source. Under the mooted arrangement, Greek fruits and vegetables would not be considered as exports. Also prominent on Wednesday's agenda was gas and energy cooperation, with Putin and Tsipras mentioning the possibility of Greek involvement in Moscow's new Turkish Stream pipeline project. Tsipras is expected to return to Russia for an economic forum in Saint-Petersburg on June 18-20. In Brussels, eurozone experts were on the second day of a working meeting Thursday poring over the reform plans Greece submitted at the end of March. The discussions were only making \"small steps\" a source said Wednesday.

The greenback has had an almost uninterrupted run against a basket of major currencies, rising almost 13 percent in 2014 and a further 9 percent this year on the view the Fed could raise rates as soon as in June. But that rally has stalled, hit by weaker US economic data in recent months, which, coupled with a more dovish central bank, has pushed market expectations for a rate hike to later in the year and possibly not until 2016. The latest poll of over 60 foreign exchange strategists taken this week suggested the dollar index will rise only 3 percent more by the end of 2015. \"A much more dovish than expected Fed post-the March  FOMC has created doubt about the USD bull market. However, the Fed's concern about a strong USD will delay, but not cancel, Fed normalisation,\" Jeremy Hale, head of macro strategy at Citi, said in a note. Still, if the dollar does rise by as much as expected, it would start to hurt the US economy, according to a smaller sample of analysts who answered an extra question. \"It (the dollar rally) is already hurting exports to some extent and the higher it goes, the more it hurts,\" said Dag Muller, financial markets analyst at  SEB. A separate Reuters poll of equity strategists last month forecast more modest gains for US shares this year than in 2014 as the firmer dollar not only drags on economic growth but threatens US corporate earnings. New York Fed President William Dudley told Reuters on Wednesday the central bank could still hike earlier than markets expect although he suggested the bar was higher for a June hike after a series of disappointing economic data. The minutes of the Fed's March meeting showed there was a wide divergence of views among policymakers and as such there is no real consensus on when the Fed will move. That suggests more volatility ahead in foreign exchange markets, especially given that the European Central Bank has just embarked on a quantitative easing programme to bring inflation back up towards its target. The poll predicted the euro will likely fall further over the next year after sliding 12 percent in 2014 and a further 11 percent so far this year. The single currency is seen holding near Thursday's trading level of $1.07 in a month. It is then expected to ease to $1.05 by end June and to $1.04 in a year. That is down from the March poll's consensus of $1.12, $1.10 and $1.08. In the latest poll, there are now more analysts calling for the euro to reach or fall below parity against the dollar compared to previous months. Others took a starkly different view, predicting an end to the euro's slide. Latest CFTC data showed currency speculators had piled up bets against the euro to a record high, suggesting the fundamental outlook will need to turn much more pessimistic for the single currency to fall any further. \"The current euro movement is a bit overdone, went too far, but there will be a slight pullback on that since we do not have an aggressive rate view on the U.S side,\" said Marko Elo, foreign exchange analyst at Pohjola Bank, one of the most accurate forecasters on the euro so far this year. Sterling is forecast at $1.47 in one month, $1.46 in three and then to gain slightly to $1.48 in a year, on expectations the Bank of England will trail the Fed in its first rate hike. That was also originally expected by mid-year but has now been pushed to late this year or early 2016. Britons go to the polls next month. When asked how the outcome of one of the closest-fought national elections in decades would affect sterling, most forecasters polled did not answer. Those who did had wildly conflicting views.

The company issued corporate non-convertible bonds for its 1,320 mw coal-fired power plant at Jhajjar in Haryana. The bond, which carries a 50% guarantee from CLP India, has a semi-annual coupon of 9.99% a year and has been issued in two series of equal amounts and will mature in April 2025 and April 2026. CLP India is the wholly owned subsidiary of Hong Konglisted China Light and Power Holdings. CLP entered the Indian power sector in 2002 with the acquisition of a 655 MW gas-fired power plant in Gujarat. \"The Jhajjar plant was financed in 2009 right after the global financial crisis when the cost of funds was very high. That was limiting the profitability of the project. The fund raised now will help us refinance our most expensive Rupee loan,\"  Rajiv Mishra, managing director, CLP India told ET. The Jhajjar plant was set up at a cost of Rs 6,300 crore, which included Rs 4,000 crore of debt. The funds raised would replace a long-term debt with interest rate of 13.5% and give a savings of almost 350 basis points on interest payment to the company. \"The innovative structure achieves the twin objectives of accessing long-term funds at competitive rates for the issuer and an attractive longterm investment opportunity for the investors. It opens up financing avenues for infrastructure projects which have been a big thrust area for the government,\" said Kaustubh Kulkarni, managing director &amp; head, debt capital markets, South Asia, Standard Chartered Bank. Standard Chartered Bank and  IDFC Limited are the lead managers to the issue. Credit-enhanced bonds are debt instruments issued by lower-rated companies to improve the credit profile of their debt issuances. In this instance, Jhajjar Power first improved its credit rating to ' A+' from 'BBB' and then with the partial guarantee from parent CLP India, their rating was enhanced to ' AA+'. \"This is a first of its kind bond issuance and we see insurance companies are getting comfortable with such opportunity. Other companies may look at this route as well but the success of it will depend on the operational performance of the company itself and the reputation of the company backing it,\" said Jayen Shah, Head-Debt Capital Market, IDFC.

Once a month, she takes her two young children to McDonald's for inexpensive breakfasts or ice cream.\n\"We call it our 'sneaky meal' because my husband thinks it's absolutely disgusting,\" said Wood, 35. \"He doesn't want to know anything about it.\"Even though Wood has fond memories of her own childhood visits to McDonald's, that doesn't mean she thinks the food is healthy. At home, she buys organic milk and meat as often as a tight family budget allows.The fact that young mothers like Wood are teaching their children not to tell their dads that they've been to McDonald's may underscore how hard it may be for the world's largest restaurant chain to remake its image and revive U.S. sales. To lure back consumers, McDonald's Corp's (MCD.N) new Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook recently pledged to eliminate chickens fed human antibiotics at its U.S. restaurants.That won't make a difference for Wood, who said she's never eaten a Chicken McNugget and has no plans to try one, even after the antibiotic change.McDonald's didn't comment for this story. The company doesn't break out what percentage of its customers are young adults and\/or mothers. \"There is still a negative health connotation,\" said Morningstar restaurant analyst R.J. Hottovy. \"It can be fixed, but it isn't an easy fix.\"Hottovy said he expects McDonald's to eventually turn around its business, but not within the next couple years. McDonald's shares fell 30 cents to $96.55 on Thursday. The shares are down 1.8 percent from a year ago, compared with a 11.7 percent gain by the benchmark Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index in the same period.Sixty percent of American adults would like more restaurants to serve antibiotic-free meat, according to a recent Reuters\/Ipsos survey of 1,364 participants. Among parents with children under the age of 18, 40 percent said they would be more likely to take the kids to McDonald's if it had antibiotic-free chicken on the menu. The Reuters\/Ipsos online poll was conducted between March 27 and 30, roughly two weeks after McDonald's announced its plan for antibiotics in chicken.According to another poll by Morgan Stanley of 3,000 U.S. adults, the cohort known as Millennials, generally defined as being 18 to 34 years old, care more about all-natural and organic ingredients than older generations. Millennials also are more likely than other groups to eat out on a weekly basis. And while they still eat more traditional fast food than other generations, they express more dissatisfaction with the category, according to the Morgan Stanley poll. That helps explain why chains like Chick-fil-A and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N), which have committed to sourcing 100 percent antibiotic-free meats, have been taking a bite out of McDonald's sales. More than one-third of parents who answered the Reuters\/Ipsos poll said they take their children to McDonald's at most a few times a year.MULTIPLE MAKEOVERSA series of critical documentaries over roughly the last decade, including \"Super Size Me\" in 2004, amplified consumer concerns about the health effect of eating fast food. McDonald's has repeatedly tried to change that image. Among other things, it introduced salads to its menu and tweaked its Happy Meals for children by adding apple slices and cutting the french-fry portion by more than half.Last year, McDonald's sought direct feedback from its U.S. diners with an online campaign called \"Our food. Your questions.\" Frequent queries included \"Is 'pink slime' in a Chicken McNugget?\" and \"Why doesn't your food rot?\" Food industry experts have said the move toward mostly antibiotic-free chicken will accelerate similar efforts by other fast-food chains and major supermarkets. It may also help curb the rise of antibiotic-resistant superbugs that contribute to thousands of U.S. deaths every year.Samantha Trujillo, 33, a stay-at-home mother of four from Yuma, Arizona, said McDonald's vow to wean chickens off most antibiotics makes her feel a little bit better about the chain and its food.\"I probably would eat the chicken a little more often,\" said Trujillo, who takes her kids out every month or two to get Happy Meals and visit the air-conditioned play area for a respite from Arizona's sweltering heat.Asked whether McDonald's antibiotic move could move the needle for the company that saw 2014 revenue, profit and traffic fall, Mark Kalinowski, restaurant analyst for Janney Capital Markets, said: \"My best guess is that it'll help only a little bit at most.\"People who care about antibiotic-free meats want them to be completely antibiotic free, Kalinowski said. \"If you're going to do it, do it. Don't be half pregnant.\"Amanda Libby, 46, a mom from Danvers, Massachusetts, agreed.

[.HK]Speaking at a media briefing on Friday, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HKEx) (0388.HK) Chief Executive Charles Li said the exchange could boost the current quotas under the Hong Kong-Shanghai stock connect program by more than 30 percent.The quotas limit how much mainland investors can buy Hong Kong stocks, and how much Hong Kong-based investors can buy stocks in China.Li did not say when the quotas would be raised.Chinese investors snapped up all of the 10.5 billion yuan ($1.7 billion) daily quota .SQUOTA.HS for buying Hong Kong stocks on both Wednesday and Thursday.

He hopes to save enough money to buy the sports version of the watch, he said.The Apple Watch sport starts at $349 while the standard version comes in at $549 in the U.S. High-end \"Edition\" watches with 18-karat gold alloys are priced from $10,000 and go as high as $17,000.\"I feel naked without a watch. I think I will buy the Apple watch with the sports band ... I'm working very hard right now so I can buy this watch,\" Bock told Reuters.The watch marks the Cupertino, California company's debut in a fledgling wearable technology market.Based on recent customer interest at its stores, Apple expects demand for the watch, which allows users to check email, listen to music and make phone calls when paired with an iPhone, to exceed availability at launch, it said on Thursday.Reviewers this week praised the watch, which also helps users monitor their health and exercise, as \"beautiful\" and \"stylish\" but gave it poor marks for relatively low battery life and slow-loading apps.For women, the various sizes and wrist bands make this smartwatch more pleasing than earlier versions from Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) and others, said Kantar World Panel market analyst Carolina Milanesi, who has been wearing the watch for a few days.At the Apple Store in Omotesando, a high-end shopping district in the heart of Tokyo, dozens of shoppers huddled around two glass displays, snapping pictures of the range of options available on the different watch models.\"I actually tried it on briefly, and it's so light it doesn't feel like it's on my wrist,\" 26-year-old salesman Yosuke Hosoi told Reuters.NOT FOR EVERYONESales estimates for 2015 vary widely. Piper Jaffray predicts 8 million units and Global Securities Research forecasts 40 million. By comparison, Apple sold nearly 200 million iPhones last year.\"Is it for everybody? No, but I don't think any wearables are yet,\" Milanesi said.Apple's watch is widely expected to outsell those by Samsung, Sony Corp (6758.T) and Fitbit, that have attracted modest interest from consumers. It will likely account for 55 percent of global smartwatch shipments this year, according to Societe Generale.Underscoring its marketing strategy, Apple is selling the watch through a handful of high-end stores including Selfridges in London, Galeries Lafayette in Paris and Isetan in Tokyo.Still, experts said Apple's offering was unlikely to displace the market share of luxury-brand watch makers.\"This is just Apple's interpretation of the watch, I don't think watch makers should be worried at all,\" Stephen Fenech, editor of the Tech Guide website, told Reuters.\"This is just Apple's expression where they've combined what they are good at with the fact that it's a watch with style so I think there's going to be room for everyone.\"JMP analyst Alex Gauna said he and others on Wall Street would be at stores this weekend to gauge consumer reaction.But the typically long queues at its stores on product launch days could be a thing of the past as the company emphasizes online sales, according to a leaked internal memo from retail chief Angela Ahrendts, reported by Business Insider.\"The days of waiting in line and crossing fingers for a product are over for our customers,\" she wrote.\"This is a significant change in mindset, and we need your help to make it happen. Tell your customers we have more availability online, and show them how easy it is to order.\"A spokesman for Apple in Sydney declined to comment on the memo, citing company policy.At an Apple Store in Hong Kong there was no queue, although half a dozen customers gathered near the shop door, cheering when it was opened. Demos were by online registration, after which a Reuters reporter received a demo without having to wait.\"I didn't know it's the first day. I am here to buy an iPad,\" said a 26-year-old customer who gave her name only as Ms Jian, visiting from China's Chongqing. \"I will take a look at the watch later.\"Apple shares closed 0.76 percent higher at $126.56 on Thursday.

Producer prices (PPI) fell slightly less than projected, contracting 4.6 percent rather than the forecasted repeat of February's 4.8 percent pace.The March inflation data is the first in a batch of key economic data that will climax with release of first-quarter growth numbers on April 15. A Reuters poll expects growth to be a six-year low of 7 percent.PRESSURE ON MARGINSPPI has now been in negative territory for three years, highlighting sustained pressure on profit margins at Chinese companies - in particular heavy industry - as Beijing struggles to restimulate headline growth.The higher-than-expected CPI was driven by a sudden rise in pork prices, which been a drag on CPI every month since December 2013.But consumer inflation is still far short of Beijing's official 3 percent target for 2015, and some economists see that goal at risk.\"Consumer price inflation held steady in March but we expect a drop in food price inflation to pull it lower over the coming months,\" wrote Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics in a research note.Producer prices were dragged down again by mining and raw materials components. Friday's data follows a surprise recovery in manufacturing activity for March, with the official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) edging up to 50.1, in expansionary territory, from February's 49.9.WORRIED POLICYMAKERSPolicymakers have publicly expressed worry that the risk of deflation is rising for the world's second-largest economy, as the drag from a property market downturn and widespread factory overcapacity is compounded by an uncertain global outlook and soft commodity prices.But while lower commodity prices have punished the extraction and power production sectors, the pain is not felt across the board, as some companies have taken advantage of lower input costs to maintain profit margins. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has made multiple cuts to guidance lending rates, and one cut to reserve requirement ratios at banks. It also launched a long-awaited deposit insurance program in April, but economists said those moves have had little impact on real borrowing costs.\"The weak inflation profile suggests that further monetary policy easing is still needed in spite of recent retreats of onshore money market rates,\" ANZ economists Zhou Hao and Liu Ligang wrote after Friday's data release.\"We believe that only permanent liquidity injection will be able to sustain the current favorable monetary conditions to head off the risk of deflation,\"  they said.The central bank has guided benchmark short-term money rates down sharply in recent weeks, and the interest rate yield curve has risen and steepened slightly as short term rates have fallen while longer term expectations have risen.

Until now.\nHe says a meeting with the new competition chief of the European Commission has left him with newfound hope that Brussels will take action at last to curb behavior by the U.S. Internet giant, which he blames for hurting his business.Danish politician Margrethe Vestager, who took over the EU competition portfolio in November, inherited an anti-trust complaint by more than a dozen companies against Google, left unresolved by her Spanish predecessor Joaquin Almunia.Almunia launched an investigation in 2010 and initially concluded that Google may have hurt competitors by favoring its own products and services in search results and blocking advertisers from moving their campaigns to rival platforms.Since then, Google has offered three settlement proposals to resolve the case. Most recently, just over a year ago, it offered to give competing products and services bigger visibility on its website, let content providers decide what material it can use for its own services and make it easier for advertisers to move their campaigns to rivals.Almunia initially accepted that deal, only to reverse his decision six months later and demand more concessions, leaving the ultimate decision to his successor.So far, Vestager has said nothing in public that would explicitly signal what course she is considering.She has also indicated that she will not rush into a decision. Asked whether enforcement regulators should emphasize quick action in cases involving fast-moving technologies, Vestager told Reuters: \"I don't think that speed should be the priority. We should be even handed and open minded in interpretation of the facts. Of course it is better to be fast than slow but it's even better to be just.\"Nevertheless, executives from some of the companies that brought the complaint against Google say they are more optimistic now than they have been for years, and that they believe action is finally coming soon.\"With Almunia, there was no real dialogue. With Vestager, it is different. The questions she asked us show that she understands the complainants' problems,\" said Weber.Another of the complainants, who spoke on condition of anonymity because a meeting with Vestager was confidential, said: \"The first thing she said at the meeting was that she understands the harm we have suffered.\"The European Commission declined to comment on the case.Google also would not comment. Spokesman Al Verney said he would not discuss anti-trust issues.HIGH STAKESThe stakes are high for Google which faces a fine of as much as $6.6 billion if found guilty of anti-competitive behavior. Even more disruptive, it may have to modify its business practices.Google's dominant positions in markets like online search, advertising and smartphone operating systems have drawn regulatory scrutiny in various jurisdictions around the globe.Its longstanding position is that competition is \"just a click away\" - a phrase meant to indicate that users have easy access to use rival services - and that its products are popular because people find them useful.Vestager, 46, was a free-trading economy minister in Denmark who jolted Danes with deep cuts to the social welfare system, earning a reputation as a firm negotiator before coming to Brussels.She has spoken in general terms of the need to keep fast-changing industries open and contestable and said both large and small players should be able to compete on the merits of their products, comments that some of the Google complainants have interpreted as sympathetic toward their case.They also note that she met some of the complainants before seeing Google's executive chairman Eric Schmidt and general counsel Kent Walker last month.In one sign of movement in recent weeks, the European Commission has asked some of the Google opponents to allow regulators to declassify some of the confidential data they submitted to justify their accusations, a step that would be necessary to present the data to Google for its response.Wilko van Weert, a partner at law firm McDermott Will &amp; Emery and specialist in the field, said Vestager could push for a settlement that would require Google to provide more information about its search ranking formula.\"Coming from a Scandinavian culture where transparency is very important, I would not be surprised if she pushes for maximum transparency in the way Google organizes and manages its search results,\" he said.Any ruling by Vestager might have to be able to survive a potential court challenge from Google, which could be tougher to withstand because of Almunia's previous reversals.Vestager may initially want to play hard ball, but that does not mean she will close the door to a settlement, said Mario Mareniello, a former economist at the Commission's competition unit and now an expert at think tank Breugel.\u201cIf at a certain point in the process effective remedies addressing her objections would be offered by Google, I guess it would be hard for her to say no,\u201d he said.

The plant currently employs 4,125, more than the required level, the city said.The city council is scheduled to hold a public hearing on April 14 to consider establishing a reinvestment zone at the location. The city has also proposed reducing taxes by 80 percent for 10 years on the expanded plant and its equipment and waiving building permit and development fees, according to a city staff report.The company, which is among the top 10 employers in Arlington according to the city's website, will spend $307 million on the physical expansion and $986 million on new equipment. \"GM is developing a business case for a potential future investment at Arlington Assembly.

EU officials said the Greek delegate made an urgent plea for cash at a meeting of deputy finance ministers in Brussels on Wednesday evening but was told there must first be progress on a stalled list of measures to make public finances sustainable.\"From the Greek side there was a strong statement that liquidity is getting really bad and there was an appeal to release some type of liquidity support before the euro zone finance ministers' meeting on April 24,\" a euro zone aide said.\n        \n        \"But no one knows how this could be done -- there is no willingness to provide support before there is some progress in terms of the reform program,\" the official said.In a small short-term boost, the European Central Bank agreed to increase the ceiling on emergency lending assistance to Greek banks by 1.2 billion euros to 73.2 billion euros, a banking source told Reuters. The ECB is reviewing the limit weekly while euro zone negotiations continue.Leftist Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, elected on a promise to end austerity, is balking at politically sensitive reforms of the pension system and labor markets to which his conservative predecessor had agreed. EU sources said Brussels was pushing Athens towards more rapidly applicable measures to liberalize product and service markets instead.Greece's creditors -- the euro zone and the IMF -- are using the leverage provided by its acute cash predicament to press for those measures to be implemented.DETAILS, NUMBERS MISSINGA European Commission spokesman stressed the importance for Greece of the finance ministers' session in Riga, telling reporters: \"Obviously, everything that happens before April 24 in terms of reaching an agreement will be greatly welcome.\"Athens submitted a 26-page list of planned reforms last week but euro zone officials said they lacked key details and proper assessments of the financial implications.The officials said trust was so low that ministers would want to see legislation going through the Greek parliament, not just promises, before they released more funds.Varoufakis accused the euro zone of inflicting toxic medicine on his country, and starving it of cash. \"Tragically we find ourselves today in a similar situation,\" he told an economic conference. \"As a finance minister ... in order to create the liquidity which is necessary to see these negotiations through hopefully to a sustainable solution, I have to make the same request that we are allowed to issue T-bills over and above a certain limit to create the liquidity necessary to see us through to the end of the month or the next month or June, so as to be able to redeem payments to the former troika -- to the IMF in this case.\"A secret memorandum drafted by the finance ministry of Finland, one of the most hardline creditor countries, raised the prospect of Greece effectively being pushed out of the euro zone if fails to meet obligations under its 240 billion euro bailout program.The newspaper Helsingin Sanomat quoted the memo, dated March 27, as saying Helsinki must be prepared for the possibility that Greece would run out of cash before the end of June. That could lead to a situation where \"by silent approval of the other euro zone countries a process is started which in effect results in Greece being expelled from the euro\", it said. The finance ministry was not available for comment.On the second day of a visit to Russia, Tsipras said in a speech at Moscow University that Russia could not be an alternative \"solution\" for Greece's debt problems to negotiations with the euro zone.But he called on the European Union to restore dialogue with Moscow despite differences over Russia's role in Ukraine.\"It is impossible to build European security without Russia, let alone against it,\" Tsipras told students. \"In this context, we must ...\u00a0restart the EU-Russia dialogue in order to address global challenges, energy cooperation and to promote mobility among citizens.\"   (Additional reporting by Philip Blenkinsop and Ingrid Melander in Brussels, Renee Maltezou in Moscow and Anna Ercanbrak in Helsinki; Writing by Paul Taylor; Editing by Giles Elgood)","pubdate":"Thu, 09 Apr 2015 21:41:36 +0530","newspaper":"Reuters"},{"title":"Fresh Harvard graduates can't be analysts in India","content":"&#13;\n         &#13;\n    &#13;\n\t&#13;\n\tIf you have just finished studying at a top global university, the Indian financial markets may not be the place for you.\u00a0&#13;\n&#13;\n\tThose who have studied from top-tier financial market education institutions including the London School of Economics, Yale, Oxford or Cambridge would all fail to meet the criteria for research analysts in India.

The key short-term monitorable are the monsoons, as it plays a key role in cash flows and the purchasing power of farmers. Bad news on this front could worsen the situation.\u201cWe see little chances of a positive earnings surprise in FY16 for stocks levered to the rural economy. In the near term, one should be underweight the (basic) rural plays, given that erratic rainfall has damaged two crops in succession, low levels of activity (construction, mining) and rationalisation of subsidies have impacted non-farm incomes, and land price increases have moderated and fallen in a few places,\u201d says Suhas Harinarayanan, head of research, JM Financial Institutional Securities.Notably, key statistics such as tractor\/automobile sales, consumer durables sales, and rural inflation and wage growth indicate a softening of that economy. Analysts believe this trend will improve only at a gradual pace, leading to muted near-term performance by companies having a high exposure to this economy. Sectors such as agri chemicals, consumer goods, automobiles and banks\/financial institutions will be more vulnerable to a weakening rural economy.Rakesh Arora, head of research at Macquarie Capital, says: \u201cWe are underweight on staples and positioned for a consumption slowdown in the rural economy. We believe slowing rural incomes will affect demand for building materials, two-wheelers and tractors. In this backdrop, we believe M&amp;M and Hero MotoCorp will be more impacted.\u201dAbout 67 per cent of M&amp;M's passenger vehicle sales and its entire tractor sales come from the rural segment. For two-wheeler companies, the rural economy contributes 40-50 per cent of sales volumes. In the consumer sector, HUL and Dabur derive about half their revenue from rural areas; this metric is about 45 per cent for Britannia. Thus, these companies will witness higher sales pressure than peers as the rural economy slows down. Interestingly, most consumer companies have invested in increasing their reach and revenues in rural areas over the past few years. This has led to higher sales contribution from these areas.&#13;\n\t&#13;\nThe volume growth estimates for FY16 can be misleading, given the low base of the preceding two years. Bajaj Auto and M&amp;M\u2019s utility vehicle portfolio saw volume contraction in FY14 and FY15. M&amp;M tractor sales volumes also fell in FY15.\u201cWe maintain our underweight-rural and preference for urban themes. Declining cash flows for the sector will have significant impact on rural themes, including consumer goods, automobiles, agri inputs and public sector banks,\u201d says Dhananjay Sinha, head of institutional equity at Emkay Global Financial Services.Agro chemicals and complex fertilisers will be hit the most by rural slowdown, though the impact on their financials will come in only with a lag effect. Falling commodity prices, though, provide some relief at the margin for these companies. \u201cOur preference remains for companies with asset-light and flexible business models such as Sharda Cropchem and Dhanuka Agritech or for companies with export exposure like UPL and PI Industries,\u201d adds Sinha of Emkay.As a large part of M&amp;M Financial and Shriram Transport's branches are in rural areas, these lenders will see impact on asset quality and credit offtake. Most banks will witness increased stress on their agricultural loans and will need to keep an eye on their asset quality. The possibility of debt waivers on agri loans could further impact this sector.","pubdate":"Thu, 09 Apr 2015 22:48:00 +0530","newspaper":"Business Standard"},{"title":"Moody's red flags banking sector; cites asset quality concerns","content":"&#13;\n         &#13;\n    &#13;\nAlthough Moody\u2019s Investor Service changed India\u2019s outlook to \u2018positive\u2019 from \u2018stable\u2019 on Thursday, the rating agency also highlighted concerns regarding India\u2019s banking sector\u2019s asset quality.&#13;\nAlthough Moody\u2019s Investor Service changed India\u2019s outlook to \u2018positive\u2019 from \u2018stable\u2019 on Thursday, the rating agency also highlighted concerns regarding India\u2019s banking sector\u2019s asset quality.While Moody\u2019s remains optimistic on the outlook for the economy and the government\u2019s reform process, it has warned that Indian banking system\u2019s asset quality, loan loss coverage and capital ratios are relatively weak.According to the rating agency, this poses sovereign credit risks due to the banking sector\u2019s role in financing growth and the government\u2019s deficits through its purchase of government securities, and the contingent liabilities owing to the government\u2019s ownership of a major portion of the banking sector.\u201cIn the absence of any improvement in banking system metrics over the coming months, India\u2019s sovereign credit profile will remain constrained,\u201d it says. However, Moody\u2019s believes the ability of policymakers to strengthen India\u2019s sovereign credit profile to a level consistent with a higher rating will only become apparent over the next 12-18 months.Despite Moody\u2019s flagging off concerns, banking stocks gained ground on Thursday with the Bank Nifty gaining 2.5 per cent to 18,876 levels. In comparison, the benchmark indices, the S&amp;P BSE Sensex and the CNX Nifty, ended 0.7 per cent higher.Punjab National Bank (PNB), IndusInd Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bank of India, Axis Bank, Canara Bank, State Bank of India (SBI) and YES Bank were among the top gainers among the banking stocks, that moved up between 2.5 and seven per cent.&#13;\n\t&#13;\nSlow road to recovery&#13;\nAnalysts believe the concerns highlighted by Moody's are not new and going ahead, the problems in the banking sector will mend. However, they caution this will be a long-drawn process.Directionally, they suggest, things have started to improve for the banking sector, although the pace of improvement is a little slow. Banks\u2019 earnings in the fourth quarter of FY15 and the next two quarters of FY16 might not be good and the stressed assets should peak in the March 2015 quarter. By the end of FY16, the level of stressed assets in the system should be lower than in the previous year.\u201cIt is quite evident from the data the kind of stress there is in the banking system, primarily in the public sector banks (PSBs). But from a forward looking view, the government\u2019s reform process should start revising the core sectors like infrastructure, power, metals etc. So, the stress levels in these banks should start coming down from FY16 and FY17 onwards,\u201d said Vaibhav Agra-wal, vice-president (research - banking) at Angel Broking.\u201cIf we put together power, infrastructure and roads, they in total account for 60-70 per cent of the restructured assets. What\u2019s left, then, is textiles and chemical sectors that are export-oriented and have stress. As regards agriculture, there are well-defined systems in place that address issues like erratic monsoon or crop failure where banks need to deal with such accounts,\u201d he adds.Ankit Ladhani, an analyst tracking the sector with Karvy Stock Broking, also expects asset quality concerns for the banking sector to continue in the fourth of FY15 results as well. The performance of private banks, however, is expected to be better than that of PSBs, although they are also expected to report higher slippages and restructuring. He maintains a \u2018buy\u2019 rating on Axis Bank, DCB Bank, Federal Bank, ICICI Bank and YES Bank; and a \u2018hold\u2019 rating on HDFC Bank.Santosh Singh, an analyst tracking the sector with Societe Generale, maintains a \u2018buy\u2019 recommendation on HDFC Bank, SBI and ICICI Bank in a March 2015 report. Key catalysts would be an interest rate cut or signs that the economy is recovering, he says.","pubdate":"Thu, 09 Apr 2015 22:47:00 +0530","newspaper":"Business Standard"},{"title":"Tea Board to try and push export","content":"&#13;\n         &#13;\n    &#13;\nThe Tea Board says it has identified more export markets, to make up for a slide in shipments elsewhere.&#13;\nThe Tea Board says it has identified more export markets, to make up for a slide in shipments elsewhere.\"The government has added Chile and China to the list of markets,\" said Azam Monem, Indian Tea Association vice-chairman. The focus, it says, is KRUCIAL - Kazakhstan, Russia, USA, China, Iran, Arab Republic of Egypt and Latin America.Exports have been slipping in recent years. From a high of 222 million kg in 2010, it dropped to 201 mn kg in 2014. The current year is not looking particularly good, too.India happens to be the fourth largest tea exporter in the world, after China, Sri Lanka and Kenya. Traditionally, our major export destinations have been Russia, UAE and Britain. Though production has been growing consistently at a compounded annual rate of three per cent, exports have been on a decline or, at best, flat. The main reason is an increase in domestic consumption, which has ensured firm prices.The unit price for exports during April 2014 to January 2015 was Rs 196.27 a kg, compared to Rs 202.60 a kg in the year-ago period. In contrast, during January-December 2014, prices at the Jakarta auction were down by Rs 14.75 a kg and Mombasa by Rs 18.03 a kg, though that at Colombo was higher by Rs 18.62 a kg.\"Firm prices have led to increasing competition from other producing countries, especially Kenya that has seen successive bumper crops,\" Monem said. Sri Lanka is also giving stiff competition.Tea production is in one of two styles, termed orthodox and non-orthodox; the latter is also commonly referred to as CTC (crush, tear, curl). Kenya is entirely a CTC producer; orthodox production accounts for almost the entire produce of Sri Lanka. In India, CTC accounts for around 90 per cent of output. Thus, Kenyan tea is in direct competition with Assam CTC, while Assam orthodox is pitted against Sri Lanka. Malawi, Mozambique and Uganda's tea are of the same quality as South Indian tea.India exports most of its orthodox production but only a small portion of CTC. Only 13 per cent of total North India (the term here refers to everything outside South India) production is exported. An ICRA report says most exports from North India are high-quality orthodox and CTC teas; South India exports medium to low quality teas that are used mainly as \"fillers\" in blending.Over the past decade, annual exports have stayed around 200 mn kg. The strategy for each of the markets the Tea Board plans to focus on would be different. For China, it would be taken up at the diplomatic level, as there are non-tariff barriers. China is predominantly a green tea market but is warming up to black tea. \"In Iran, there is a plan for joint promotion with packers. In Russia, the rupee-rouble mechanism needs to be worked on,\" Monem said.The industry is hoping that June-September, the time for exports, would see better weather and so, more production. So far, a dry spell has affected production.","pubdate":"Thu, 09 Apr 2015 22:34:00 +0530","newspaper":"Business Standard"},{"title":"Govt to re-introduce technology upgradation fund for textiles","content":"&#13;\n         &#13;\n    &#13;\nThe Union government is to re-introduce the Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (Tufs), perhaps for at least 10 years, in the new textile policy, scheduled to be out by month-end.&#13;\nThe Union government is to re-introduce the Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (Tufs), perhaps for at least 10 years, in the new textile policy, scheduled to be out by month-end.In the revised policy, the onus of funding the sector is likely to be put on the states where factories exist. \u201cWe have increased states\u2019 share in central taxes to 42 per cent from 32 per cent earlier. So, we are looking to introduce Tufs with some tweaks; states might be asked to fund it. We are looking for a long-term policy, for at least 10-15 years. However, a final decision is yet to be taken,\u201d said Sanjay Kumar Panda, secretary, ministry of textiles, here on Thursday.Tufs, implemented from April 1999, was introduced to catalyse investments in the textile and jute industry, with a five per cent interest reimbursement. The scheme was initially approved from April 1999 to March 2004, extended to 2007 with modifications and further restructured with effect from April 2011, to March 2012.In 2012, then commerce minister Anand Sharma announced its continuation for the 12th Plan period of 2012-17, with an outlay of Rs 11,900 crore. Of this, Rs 6,000 crore has been released so far.\u201cWe will ask for the remaining Rs 6,000 crore for the rest of the Plan period. Depending upon the money available, the ministry will take a final decision on allocation in the various sectors,\u201d Panda added.The industry utilised Rs 12,383 crore against the budgetary allocation of Rs 13,785 crore during the 11th Plan. Restructured Tufs allocations did not prescribe sectoral ceilings for the spinning, powerloom and handloom sectors. Investments in spinning were Rs 34,347 crore and in the weaving sector, including powerlooms and handlooms, Rs 9,750 crore.\u201cLooking at the scheme\u2019s success in the past, we are pushing for Tufs very aggressively.

However, the survey sees demand improving and so prices, which could average to $1,170 in 2015 and $1,250 in the following year, the survey says.\u201cThe dollar is likely to retain currency supremacy, given monetary policy elsewhere in the world, and non-dollar-denominated gold prices are believed to have bottomed.\u201d In dollar terms, however, the GFMS team at Thomson Reuters, \u201cis looking for further slippage towards $1,100 per ounce during 2015, with an annual average of $1,170 per ounce in 2015, with prices rising towards year-end; this should lead to an average of $1,250 per ounce in 2016, as buying picks up in Asian markets and institutional investment in these markets offsets the recent decline in over-the-counter demand in the West.\u201dThe reasoning behind bottoming out of prices in local currencies is that a strengthening dollar would result in depreciation of other currencies and, hence, even if gold\u00a0 slips further in dollar terms, depreciation in other countries\u2019 local currency would not let the dollar price to fall much.Like most markets, gold also takes time to recover from periods of turbulence and, in early 2015, it is continuing the stabilisation of 2014 following the hurricane that swept through it in the previous year.For gold prices to go up, there is a need for fresh investment. Hence, the survey sees possibility of further shorts in gold.\u201cIndeed, there is still the possibility of short-side sales in response to any unsettling news or economic development. Once the new rate cycle is in place (or signalled), asset reallocation is likely to commence and we expect gold to benefit accordingly,\u201d the survey says.Official sector gold transactions in 2014 amounted to an estimated net purchase of 466 tonnes, up 14 per cent from 2013 and the second highest level since the end of the gold standard. The renewed eastward shift in physical gold demand (following the westward lurch following the start of the financial crisis) stalled last year, but is expected to resume as the markets continue to stabilise.A study conducted by StratWon Business Consulting for Platinum Guild International (PGI) showed the growth in platinum sales at 28 per cent in 2014. Sales by PGI\u2019s strategic retail partners were up by 33 per cent during 2014 while other outlets reported a growth of 19 per cent.\u201cGiven the overall market scenario, the platinum growth for 2014 has been very positive and consistent which comes from continuous improvement of consumer sentiment, higher conversion at the retail stores and improving the disposition for platinum among our key target audience. With the launch of Platinum Evara on the back of strong consumer research at the end of the year we are looking at further accelerating growth. The initial response to this new category has been very positive,\u201d said Vaishali Banerjee, country manager India, PGI.The jewellery fabrication business has increased six per cent in 2014 globally, except in China. The result of the massive surge in jewellery demand in China in 2013 was a fall of 35 per cent in Chinese jewellery consumption and 31 per cent in local jewellery fabrication last year. Even so, the Chinese jewellery fabrication in 2014 was seven per cent higher than in 2012 and the second highest on record. Heavy leasing activity in the local market has led to suggestions that retail demand was much higher than was actually the case. India, despite import restrictions, reached another record in both fabrication and consumption terms, reflecting the determined affinity of the people for gold. China and India together accounted for 54 per cent of the world\u2019s jewellery, bar and medal demand in 2014.","pubdate":"Thu, 09 Apr 2015 22:32:00 +0530","newspaper":"Business Standard"},{"title":"Headless FMC's senior member, directors also moving out","content":"&#13;\n         &#13;\n    &#13;\nThe Forward Markets Commission (FMC), regulator for commodity derivatives, is headless with chairman Ramesh Abhishek\u2019s term having ended on Wednesday and no successor appointed.&#13;\nThe Forward Markets Commission (FMC), regulator for commodity derivatives, is headless with chairman Ramesh Abhishek\u2019s term having ended on Wednesday and no successor appointed.Sources say this is preparation for merging FMC with the securities market regulator, Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), proposed in this year's Union Budget.

A substantial increase in new fund launches, mostly closed-end ones, with higher commissions attached, acted as a big catalyst to bring investors for three to five years.

While Crisil Research expects India Inc\u2019s revenue growth to slip to a seven-quarter low of 2.5 per cent, other research houses expect Sensex revenue growth to be flat to minus seven per cent. On the other hand, Sensex earnings growth is estimated in the range of -7.6 per cent to 5.6 per cent for the March quarter. In the December quarter, Sensex earnings had contracted five per cent.Worse, a dramatic moderation in profit growth of defensive sectors, which had propped the broader market in recent years. Over the past few weeks, analysts have downgraded earnings estimates of Sensex companies on more than one occasion. The result is a lack of consensus among equity strategists. Not many were expecting earnings\u2019 downgrades of so many sectors in a short span. This has made forecast of earnings growth a lot more difficult, leading to a divergence in estimates (see table). In fact, there is scope for further downgrades.Currently, even the most optimistic estimate suggests Sensex earnings growth by no more than six to nine per cent in FY15. Edelweiss says: \u201cGiven the poor earnings expectations, another two-three per cent downgrade in EPS (earnings per share) is likely.\u201dKotak Institutional Equities writes: \u201cVery few stocks offer any value on reasonable earnings assumptions. Some are terribly expensive and some face earnings downgrades from tenuous earnings assumptions.\u201dAmbit Capital\u2019s Nitin Bhasin writes, \u201cFollowing a disappointing third quarter and with signs of moderation across sectors, our analysts have downgraded their estimates for Q4 from three months ago for the majority of sectors. The more notable downgrades are in the automobile, consumer, cement, financials and E&amp;C (engineering &amp; construction) sectors.\u201dThe sharp drop in earnings of commodity-oriented sectors, oil &amp; gas and metals &amp; mining, are expected to dent the performance of cyclicals. While defensives matter from an earnings perspective, cyclicals account for 58 per cent of the benchmark\u2019s revenues. The big worry is the defensives (information technology or IT, pharmaceutical &amp; consumer goods). Their revenue growth is expected to almost halve to 10.7 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y), against the 20.2 per cent y-o-y rise in Q4 of FY14, says ICICI Securities.&#13;\n\t&#13;\nThe sharp pullback in government spending over the past two quarters, impact of deficient and unseasonal rain on rural India, and the dollar\u2019s strength against all other currencies have come together to hurt the earnings trajectory of corporate India.For IT companies, Q4 is historically weak. This one is expected to be worse, due to cross-currency headwinds. The dollar\u2019s strengthened by four to 10 per cent against most other major currencies, which would hurt the earnings of companies with a strong presence outside America. Sequential dollar revenue growth might remain flat or fall up to three per cent for many. Earnings growth, too, for most large IT companies is likely to be muted.Among other key sectors, metals might be the worst hit. While domestic steel demand is weak, a 60 per cent surge in Chinese imports is hurting business. Led by global cues, domestic prices are down eight to 10 per cent, impacting profit. Edelweiss estimates Tata Steel\u2019s net profit to fall by 95 per cent, while Kotak estimates a net loss of Rs 130 crore versus a consolidated profit of Rs 1,060 crore in Q4 of FY14. Profits of Jindal and JSW Steel are also seen falling sharply. Base metal companies Hindalco and Sesa Sterlite are expected to see a sharp decline in profit. The decline here of Tata Steel, Sesa Sterlite and Hindalco means their contribution to the Sensex profit after tax (PAT) will shrink from over five per cent last year to about one per cent in Q4.Engineering and capital goods companies will also see pressure on profits, particularly Bharat Heavy Electricals expected to be a drag for this sector. Positively, banking, financial services and insurance is expected to deliver healthy earnings growth. A big contributor to the Sensex PAT (13.5 per cent in the year-ago quarter), it has a strong influence on overall numbers. Earnings will be led by private sector banks Axis and HDFC, seen posting an 18-22 per cent rise in profit. Edelweiss analysts, led by Nilesh Parikh, say: \u201cIndustry credit growth, running at multi-year lows, will exert pressure on top-line growth of banks, especially public sector players facing capital and asset quality challenges, while private banks will continue to outpace industry growth.\u201dOil &amp; gas will also be a mixed bag but broadly positive. Oil marketing companies should deliver good operating performance, led by strong gross refining margins (GRMs). However, there is no clarity on net realisations. Among Sensex companies, strong GRMs mean Reliance Industries will deliver good performance. Estimates peg its profit at Rs 5,900-6,300 crore. Though oil prices are down (so, lower contribution on account of its stake in Cairn\u2019s oilfields), Oil &amp; Natural Gas Corporation should benefit on account of a lower subsidy burden.So, too, with automobiles. Two-wheelers have seen pressure on volumes, while passenger cars and commercial vehicles have fared better. The sector is expected to grow headline revenues in low single digits but net profit growth is expected to be about 10 per cent, led by better margins (lower input costs and currency gains).","pubdate":"Thu, 09 Apr 2015 22:14:00 +0530","newspaper":"Business Standard"},{"title":"More reforms in store for debt market in FY16","content":"&#13;\n         &#13;\n    &#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n\tThe financial year 2015-16 is set to turn out to be a year for debt market reforms as experts believe there are many positive steps in the offing after the already announced measures. Though it is agreed that these reforms were long pending since many years, the street believes among the other measures Credit Default Swaps (CDS) could be relaunched, steps to enhance liquidity in corporate bonds may be announced and a full fledged screen based trading system for corporate bonds may be put in place.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tIn the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) first bi-monthly monetary policy earlier this week, the central bank said that they will formulate a scheme for market making by primary dealers in semi-liquid and illiquid government securities.&#13;\n&#13;\n\t\"A similar step could perhaps be taken by asking merchant bankers in corporate bonds by asking them to provide liquidity in bonds. That will add to substantial amount of liquidity in bonds. Today once the bonds gets sold in the market, these merchant bankers no longer provide liquidity to the market,\" said R Sivakumar, head of fixed income and products, Axis Mutual Fund.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tRBI also announced steps to boost retail participation in government securities. These measures include a web-based solution for all mid-segment and retail investors who have gilt accounts to participate in the government securities market and providing these investors direct access to both primary and secondary market platforms without any intermediary. For this, alternate channels of distribution of government securities would be created, RBI said.&#13;\n&#13;\n\t\"Retail participation in government securities will take a long time as fixed deposit rates are more attractive. There is scope for reforms in corporate bond market. For instance, it is critical to have a full fledged screen based trading system for bonds,\" said S Prabhu, head of fixed income at IDBI Federal Life Insurance.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tCurrently, secondary market activity in corporate bonds continues to be negligible when compared with the volumes in government securities. Besides that though CDS made its debut in 2011, but the instruments failed to take off. CDS are instruments where the buyers receives credit protection while the seller of the swap guarantees the credit worthiness of the debt security.&#13;\n&#13;\n\t\"The CDS market is needed because those who invest in corporate bonds, are exposed to interest rate risks as well as credit risks due to which there is a need for this instrument.

It describes this as a \"world class potential resource\" and that the well has the \"potential for significant daily oil production\".  Compared with similar geology in the US and West Siberia, it estimates that 3% to 15% of the oil could be recovered. Underground riches Oil has been produced onshore in the South of England for decades. There are currently around a dozen oil production sites across the Weald, a region spanning Kent, Sussex, Surrey and Hampshire. Last year, a report for the government by the British Geological Survey estimated that the region may have shale oil resources in the range of 2.2-to-8.5 billion barrels, with a central estimate of 4.4 billion barrels of oil.\n\n    \n        \n            Horse Hill oil find \n            \n            \n                        \n            \n            \n                        \n            \n                                          5%-15% of the oil will be eventually recovered (estimated) \n                                    \n                                \n                                          2,500ft-3,000ft  depth at which the oil is thought to lie \n                                    \n                                \n                                          45 billion barrels extracted from the North Sea in 40 years \n                                    \n                            \n        \n        \n                    Getty Images\n            \n\nUKOG says that it drilled the deepest well in the region in the last 30 years and that the results  \"comprehensively change the understanding of the area's potential oil resources\". \"Based on what we've found here, we're looking at between 50 and 100 billion barrels of oil in place in the ground,\" says Mr Sanderson. \"We believe we can recover between 5% and 15% of the oil in the ground, which by 2030 could mean that we produce 10%-to-30% of the UK's oil demand from within the Weald area.\"'Significant'Work currently under way at Imperial College also suggests that there may be more oil in the region than previously thought. Professor Alastair Fraser has used some of the most sophisticated equipment in the world, based at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, to analyse rock samples. His study of a third of the Weald came up with a resource of 13 billion barrels. \"So if I scaled that up, we are coming up to numbers of 40 billion barrels,\" he told the BBC. \"Now that's getting significant. That's a resource. That's what's there in the ground. We've still got to get it out.\"Fracking unnecessaryMost experts believe fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, will be needed to get commercial quantities of oil from the region. Concerns over fracking led to large-scale protests when Cuadrilla drilled at Balcombe, West Sussex, in 2013.But UKOG has consistently stated that it is not intending to use fracking, which involves pumping water, sand and chemicals into rocks at high pressure to liberate the oil and gas trapped within. It says that the oil at Horse Hill is held in rocks that are naturally fractured, which \"gives strong encouragement that these reservoirs can be successfully produced using conventional horizontal drilling and completion techniques\".The company says further drilling and well testing will be needed to prove these initial results.\n    ","pubdate":"Thu, 09 Apr 2015 11:42:46 +0530","newspaper":"BBC"},{"title":"LinkedIn buys learning firm for $1.5bn","content":"\n                        LinkedIn has about 300 million members who use the site's business networking tools\n                    \n                LinkedIn has bought US online learning business Lynda for $1.5bn (\u00a31.1bn), making it the professional networking site's biggest acquisition to date.LinkedIn is trying to boost the business content it offers to its 300 million users.Lynda, based in California, has made hundreds of videos that teach subscribers everything from coding to business skills.Subscribers pay $375 per year to access the tutorials.Although the company was founded nearly 20 years ago, it has expanded rapidly in the past two years, adding several languages to its video offerings and increasing outside investment.\"The mission of LinkedIn and the mission of lynda.com are highly aligned,\" said LinkedIn chief executive Jeff Weiner in a statement. \"Both companies seek to help professionals be better at what they do.\" Shares in LinkedIn rose more than 1.5% on the New York Stock Exchange after news of the acquisition was released.\n    ","pubdate":"Fri, 10 Apr 2015 03:30:35 +0530","newspaper":"BBC"},{"title":"Eurozone: Six days for Greek deal","content":"The eurozone has said only six working days are left for Greece to come up with a revised list of reforms to seal a deal on its next rescue bailout.Eurozone deputy finance ministers want an agreement on the \u20ac7.2bn loan in time for a Eurogroup meeting on 24 April.An EU official said: \"If you take into account weekends and Orthodox Easter, there are only six days left.\"It comes as Greece said it had met Thursday's deadline to repay \u20ac460m to the International Monetary Fund.A Greek government official told the Reuters news agency: \"The payment has been made.\"Financial helpOther, much larger, debt repayments are due within a few weeks.Analysis: Chris Morris, BBC News, AthensGreece has fulfilled its financial commitments today, but the situation is becoming rather desperate.

The researchers say it has advantages over lithium-ion batteries, common in electronic devices like smartphones, as well as traditional alkaline batteries.Other scientists have said the work is exciting but still at a very early stage.\"We have developed a rechargeable aluminium battery that may replace existing storage devices, such as alkaline batteries, which are bad for the environment, and lithium-ion batteries, which occasionally burst into flames,\" said senior author Prof Hongjie Dai from Stanford University in California.\"Our new battery won't catch fire, even if you drill through it.\" In fact, a video made by the research team shows that the battery even continues to work for a short period after being punished in this way. We may not expect batteries to withstand such treatment routinely - but this demonstration certainly sets the new design apart from lithium-ion batteries, which have faced safety concerns including recent bans on air transport.Because it is lightweight and inexpensive, aluminium has attracted interest from battery engineers for many years, but it has never yielded a viable product.Key to the new discovery was the choice of material for the other, positive electrode (the cathode) to go with aluminium for the negative electrode (or anode). Graphite - a form of carbon in which the atoms form thin, flat sheets - turned out to deliver very good performance, while also being similarly lightweight, cheap and widely available.\n                        The cathode looks like a graphite sponge, pictured here using a microscope (white line is 1cm in the inset, 0.3mm in the main image)\n                    \n                To connect the two electrodes, the pouch is filled with liquid. \"The electrolyte is basically a salt that's liquid at room temperature, so it's very safe,\" said PhD student Ming Gong, another of the study's authors. This contrasts with the flammable electrolytes used in lithium-ion batteries. \nI think it's very exciting and it gives new pointers as to how one might get that type of chemistry to workProf Clare Grey, University of Cambridge\n'Early days'The battery performed particularly well when the team made the graphite cathode into a foam: a sponge-like pattern of tiny whiskers of the stuff, surrounding many empty pockets. This allows ions in the electrolyte solution very easy access to the graphite, helping the battery to work faster.When the battery discharges, aluminium dissolves at the anode, while aluminium-containing ions slide into the spaces between atomic graphite layers at the cathode. When it charges again, the reverse occurs, depositing metallic aluminium metal back on the anode.Crucially, this can take place through more than 7,500 complete cycles without the battery losing any capacity - several times more than most lithium-ion batteries, and hundreds of times better than any previous experimental designs that used aluminium.Similarly, the device's two-volt output is the best seen from an aluminium battery. It is also better than common 1.5-volt alkaline batteries, but lags behind the output of the lithium-ion batteries we use in smartphones and laptops.\n                        Lithium batteries are commonly used but have faced safety concerns\n                    \n                \"Our battery produces about half the voltage of a typical lithium battery,\" Prof Dai said. \"But improving the cathode material could eventually increase the voltage and energy density.\"Nonetheless, his team has high hopes for their design. Already, just by strapping two of the pouch batteries together and plugging them into an adaptor, they managed to charge up a smartphone in a minute. They also suggest it could be very useful in flexible displays, one of the proposals for the next generation of electronics.Prof Dai clearly believes its voltage is the battery's single main limitation: \"Our battery has everything else you'd dream that a battery should have: inexpensive electrodes, good safety, high-speed charging, flexibility and long cycle life.\"I see this as a new battery in its early days. It's quite exciting.\"Problem of scaleClare Grey, a materials chemist at the University of Cambridge, said the work was \"definitely a step-change\" for aluminium batteries.\"Aluminium batteries are very difficult technology and I think their method of storing the charges inside the graphite is rather clever,\" Prof Grey told BBC News.But she added that turning the prototype into a larger commercial product would be challenging. One problem is that the process of squeezing ions in between the graphite sheets can cause the material to expand and contract, which is \"bad news for the battery\", Prof Grey explained.\"And then also, the bigger the graphite sheets are, the further the ions have got to diffuse in - so the slower it gets. So part of reason it's got this high rate is that it's got very small platelets of graphite.\"She was impressed by the concept and the demonstration of the new design, however.\"I think it's very exciting and it gives new pointers as to how one might get that type of chemistry to work,\" Prof Grey said.Follow Jonathan on Twitter\n    ","pubdate":"Tue, 07 Apr 2015 22:13:14 +0530","newspaper":"BBC"},{"title":"Tesco wins \u00a31.50 milk compensation","content":"\n                        Every little helps: Tesco requested compensation for the milk\n                    \n                Supermarket giant Tesco has won \u00a31.50 compensation from a customer who spilt a bottle of milk in one of its stores.Shopper Cornelius Price, 40, threw the six-pint bottle in a temper, Llandrindod Wells Magistrates' Court heard.It was claimed he was verbally abusive and escorted off the premises.Admitting criminal damage, Price said he threw the milk towards the store manager saying \"catch it\" but it accidentally spilt.\"He was told to return the milk he was holding and leave the store and he threw it at the floor in temper,\" said Julie Sullivan, prosecuting.\"\u00a31.50 compensation is requested for the milk.\"Phil Sherrard, defending, said: \"This is minor criminal damage.

Many in Kurdistan have not been paid for months.Commander Faridon Jwanroyi holds up his AK-47 rifle and fires off a few rounds, purely for my benefit. \"I wish there was Islamic State here, I could fire at them!\" he jokes. I would have asked for a more dramatic display, but the Peshmerga - the Kurdish fighting force here - are a bit short on weaponry. In fact they're a bit short on ammunition, too. And since December, they've even run out of money to pay their soldiers.\"Some haven't been paid in three months,\" he confides, when we met in late March. \"It's hard. They have to pay for their rent, for the children's clothes. But still, we fight on. We have belief.\" Weaker oil pricesBut with talk now of a combined Iraqi-Kurdish operation to liberate Iraq's second city, Mosul, it is an open question whether belief alone can bring victory. Indeed, a financial crisis has been brewing for several months. The halving of the global oil price - undercutting Kurdistan's main source of revenue - and the effect of the war have both had a deleterious effect, especially after fighting in August saw the black flags of Islamic State (IS) come just 19 miles (30km) from Erbil, the capital of the Kurdish autonomous region in northern Iraq.\"When IS is at the door, logically it's hard to convince foreign investors that Erbil's safe and nothing's wrong,\" says Govan Haji Akravi, chief executive of Fastnet, an internet systems provider for foreign companies in the city. \"Almost from one day to another, many of them packed up and left.\" \n                        Some Kurdish fighters have not been paid for three months, says their commander, Faridon Jwanroyi\n                    \n                \n                        Islamic State fighters came within 19 miles (30km) of the regional capital Erbil last summer\n                    \n                Displaced peopleThere's also been a major refugee crisis. Some one-and-a-half million displaced people have arrived in Kurdistan, fleeing the fighting in Syria and northern Iraq. That's a 30% increase in the population of the region, leading to huge extra stresses, I'm told, on local services like water and education. The refugees are mostly housed in improvised camps. One of the more bizarre is the Ankawa Mall - a half-built shopping centre on the outskirts of Erbil. Like many building projects, it was abandoned by its developer as the crisis hit last year. Now the raw concrete shell is occupied by some 4,000 Iraqi Christians from the Mosul region, sleeping in alcoves created for designer boutiques. A makeshift wickerwork crucifix hangs over the entrance. One of the refugees, Issa, charges about 30 cents for a haircut and shave in his makeshift barber's shop in the main atrium at the foot of two massive escalators that are now derailed and disintegrating. \"I'm cheaper than the Kurdish barbers here,\" he tells me. \"No one wants to look hairy like the guys from Islamic State, so they come to me!\" he laughs. But the smile quickly fades. Life in the shopping centre is miserable, he says: \"It's like a camp for chickens.\" He dreams of escaping to Europe.    \n                        About 1.5 million refugees have fled to Kurdistan\n                    \n                \n                        The population of the region has risen by 30%\n                    \n                \n                        \"No one wants to look hairy like the guys from Islamic State,\" says Issa, a barber in one of the refugee camps\n                    \n                Dispute with BaghdadPerhaps the biggest economic challenge for Kurdistan stems from its troubled relations with central government. For the last year, Baghdad has only fitfully been paying the regional government in Erbil its share of the national budget. Under the constitution, Baghdad requires the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) to share its own oil production with the rest of the country. The Kurds should then be reimbursed with 17% of the total nationwide budget, which is currently set at $105bn (\u00a371bn).  Baghdad has accused Erbil of selling oil illegally, without its authority, and of failing to meet production quotas - allegations the Kurds deny. \"Baghdad knows very well we are selling oil - we have to pay people's salaries,\" says Dr Ali Sindi, the KRG's minister of planning. \"Meanwhile five million Iraqi citizens have been cut off from their rightful share of the nation's resources. This is a threat to the stability and the sustainability of the region,\" he says.The anger in Kurdistan is all the greater since Baghdad is continuing to pay salaries to government workers living under Islamic State. Even some refugees - civil servants displaced from Mosul - are, it is said, receiving their salaries from within the camps, whilst some of those caring for them haven't been paid since December.In the last three weeks, Baghdad has announced a breakthrough, saying it is renewing budget payments, although so far these amount to less than half what is owed for just March alone. Salaries for most workers, including soldiers, remain many months in arrears. The Iraqi Prime Minister, Haider Al-Abadi, has been quoted as blaming delays on a wider economic crisis in Baghdad. \n                        Under Iraq's constitution, the Kurds have to share their own oil output with the rest of the country\n                    \n                \n                        Kurdistan should be getting $105bn (\u00a371bn) from the central government in Baghdad\n                    \n                'We don't give up'\"If we don't reach a lasting solution, we will have to handle it through our own export of oil,\" says Dr Sindi. Kurdistan is this month said to be completing a new pipeline to its northern neighbour, Turkey. But despite the threats, few in Erbil believe Kurdistan has the political power to cut its own deals with the wider world.  In the meantime, some state employees are getting desperate. Civil servant Najad Amin and his wife Iqbal say they expect the last of their savings to run out in the next month. They've started growing vegetables in their back garden, to help feed the family. Do they blame the politicians in Baghdad or in Erbil, I ask?\"They're all to blame,\" they say. \"But we Kurds are used to depending on ourselves. We will find a way. We don't give up, absolutely.\" \n    ","pubdate":"Fri, 10 Apr 2015 04:45:26 +0530","newspaper":"BBC"},{"title":"Cybersecurity v human rights in Africa","content":"\n                        As internet usage rises in Africa, so does cybercrime\n                    \n                Think cybercrime and Africa, and most people in the developed world think of the notorious 419 email scam.This involves gangs extorting money from the likes of great aunt Mabel by promising her riches, if she'll just send some cash and\/or her bank details to a nice man in Nigeria. But cybercrime on the continent has moved far beyond this, with gangs embracing more sophisticated ways to use technology, such as malware and botnets, to get what they want.Internet usage is rising rapidly in Africa, and with it, cybercrime.This growth is making it easier than ever for criminals to operate. And it has created a new pool of potential victims lacking the knowledge and experience to be able to protect themselves effectively.VictimsSecurity expert Kaspersky says more than 49 million cyber-attacks took place on the continent in the first quarter of last year, with most occurring in Algeria, ahead of Egypt, South Africa and Kenya.But cybercrime is actually most pervasive in South Africa, with security firm Norton saying 70% of South Africans have fallen victim to cybercrime, compared with 50% globally.McAfee, another cybersecurity firm, reported that cybercrime cost South African companies more than $500m (\u00a3340m) last year.\n                        In South Africa 70% of people have been victims of cybercrime, says Norton\n                    \n                Baby stepsAfrica has long lacked a legal framework for tackling cybercrime.But in June 2014, the African Union (AU) approved a convention on cybersecurity and data protection that could see many countries enact personal protection laws for the first time.For it to be implemented, however, 15 of the 54 AU member states will need to ratify the text. As yet, not one country has done so, though there is optimism it will happen in the next three-to-five years. \"Cybersecurity is a growing concern for the nations of the African Union as more people come online,\" says Drew Mitnick, junior policy counsel at human rights organisation Access, which has called on member states to ratify the convention as soon as possible.\"It is critical for the countries to adopt cybersecurity policies that better protect users while respecting their privacy and other human rights.\" \n                        The African Union (AU) is made up of 54 member states - only Morocco doesn't belong\n                    \n                Access believes the AU should lead these efforts. The group has tracked proposed cyber and data protection laws in Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritania, Morocco, Tanzania, Tunisia and Uganda. In each case, the legislation would either fail to provide basic protection for user data, or allow the government to violate the rights of privacy, expression, and assembly, Access believes.But Beza Belayneh, managing director of the African Cyber Risk Institute (ACRI), says there are positives.\"[The convention] is a jumpstart for many countries who do not have any legal ground or appreciation to combat cybercrime,\" he says.\"It is a good guide to develop... computer or cybersecurity laws in a localised manner. It is the best way just to start the job. It has to start somewhere.\"It is apparent that many, if not all, African countries lack the capabilities to defend their ever-growing cyber infrastructure.\"Cybersecurity is finally receiving the attention it deserves, he added.Ducks in a rowAs a guide to helping African nations get their \"cyber ducks in order\", as Mr Belayneh puts it, the AU convention isn't too bad. Mr Mitnick says the convention contains a data protection provision covering control of personal data, with a large part of it mirroring the data protection framework and language developed by the European Union.He also commends the protection of human rights. \"The text requires governments to uphold the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, along with other basic rights such as \"freedom of expression, the right to privacy, and the right to a fair hearing, among others,\" he says.\"The inclusion of privacy is most welcome, considering it is not explicitly found in the African Charter.\"\n                        The AU proposals include giving judges unlimited power to issue search and seizure warrants on data or computers - causing understandable concern about human rights\n                    \n                'Negative effects'However, there are real concerns about some of the provisions. The Centre for Intellectual Property and Information Technology Law at Strathmore University, Kenya, is against implementation in its current form.It believes the convention could limit freedom of expression and allow authorities to intercept private data too easily. Judges would be given unlimited power to issue search and seizure warrants on data or computers, for example.All this could have \"substantial negative effects on online economies and social cultures across Africa,\" it says.\n                        A woman uses a tablet at an internet cafe in Dakar, Senegal\n                    \n                Mr Belayneh agrees that the document gives too much power to judges and law enforcement arms of governments, and says it fails to take into account the roles of education and consultation in combating cybercrime.\"It was written by lawyers,\" he says. \"Cybersecurity and cybercrime need a multi-sectoral approach - cybersecurity educators, researchers, NGOs [non-governmental organisations], vendors, ethical hackers were supposed to be involved so they could present a multi-dimensional framework instead of legal paper.\"\n                        Does criminalising \"insulting language\" allow governments to clamp down on dissent?\n                    \n                Some of the convention's phrases seem to be in direct conflict with protecting human rights. For instance, while the convention limits the processing of personal data, it contains an exception for a task \"carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority\" - a loophole ripe for abuse, some experts believe.Mr Mitnick says the convention could also pave the way for harsh criminal convictions. \"In one example, it limits the use of insulting language, which could describe a significant portion of the language on the internet and is likely to lead to subjective prosecutions,\" he says.Though the experts believe the convention is satisfactory as a first step, the negatives are certainly clear for all to see. \n    ","pubdate":"Fri, 10 Apr 2015 04:48:55 +0530","newspaper":"BBC"},{"title":"Australian firms take to four wheels","content":"Hairdresser Ep Weatherhead has a business that is going places.The owner of the first mobile barber's shop in Australia, from Tuesdays to Saturdays she parks her converted van at different locations across Sydney's beachside suburb of Maroubra.Together with one part-time member of staff, she cuts the hair of 40 men and boys on an average day.The business - called The Barber Van - was set up in 2011 with 60,000 Australian dollars ($46,000; \u00a331,000) of investment.

I have priced it and it would be prohibitive.\" Yet despite the restrictions on what haircuts she can offer, she has plans to expand across Australia.In the meantime she has secured a regular contract with the Royal Australian Navy to drive her van to three naval bases.\"This represents the growth I have been waiting for,\" she says.\n    ","pubdate":"Thu, 09 Apr 2015 04:30:58 +0530","newspaper":"BBC"},{"title":"Q&A: What is a non-dom?","content":"\n                        Non-dom status has been a source of debate for some time\n                    \n                The non-domicile rule, that allows some UK residents to limit the tax paid on earnings outside the country, has been a regular topic of debate in recent years.Various changes have been made to the way people face charges in the UK if they wish to keep their non-dom status.Still, the tax status remains, and there is an element of mystery about it - with the number of non-doms in the UK a matter of informed guesswork.Now the Labour Party has vowed to scrap non-dom status, with some caveats to protect temporary workers, if it wins power in the general election.What is a non-dom?A non-dom is a UK resident whose permanent home, or domicile, is outside of the UK. A domicile is usually the country his or her father considered his permanent home when he or she was born, or it may be the place overseas where somebody has moved to with no intention of returning.That means somebody can be born, be educated and work in the UK but still hold non-dom status. It also means that some may inherit their non-dom status from their parents.For proof to the tax authority, they have to provide evidence about their background, lifestyle and future intentions, such as where they own property or intend to be buried.Key to non-dom tax status is that an individual must pay UK tax on UK earnings, but need not pay UK tax on foreign income or gains unless they bring that income back to the UK.Has this system been around for a while?Yes, for more than 200 years.The FT says it was originally introduced in 1799 and allowed people with foreign property to shelter it from wartime taxes.It became a regular point of debate during and after the financial crisis when the legal tax affairs of wealthy residents was put under the spotlight.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPolicy guide: Taxation\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tThis election issue includes income tax and national insurance levies and business taxes.\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\tHow many non-doms are there?This is where things become a little more opaque.People do not necessarily have to indicate their domicile status on their UK tax return. The UK tax authority believes there was a general trend of rising numbers to 2008 when charges came in, but a fall since.There were an estimated 114,800 non-doms in 2012-13, according to the latest figures available.Non-doms have included some super-wealthy household names, but also include some foreign doctors and nurses working for the NHS, as well as some students.What tax charges do non-doms face?Non-doms who have lived in the UK for seven of the last nine years must pay \u00a330,000 each year to maintain their tax status.Those living in the UK for 12 of the last 14 years must pay \u00a350,000 to do so.Non-doms living in the UK for 17 of the last 20 years must pay \u00a390,000 to keep their non-dom status.About 5,000 people pay these charges, raising an estimated \u00a3300m this year for the Treasury.Some other countries have similar regimes, but the seven-year period of grace is unusual internationally.What would scrapping non-dom status mean?There would still be a period of time where temporary workers and students can legally maintain their domicile overseas.However, the big questions raised by effectively scrapping non-dom status include:Whether there will be a flight of non-doms who paid an estimated \u00a36.2bn in UK tax in 2012-13\nHow much can be raised in UK taxes if former non-doms decide to stay?\nWill that tax income outstrip the amount raised from non-dom charges? Labour says it would do so by several hundred million pounds but this is very difficult to quantify\nWhat will be the effect on jobs and business creation in the UK?\nWhether this will create a more even playing field among entrepreneurs irrespective of their domicile\nThe debate is likely to continue whichever party wins the election.","pubdate":"Wed, 08 Apr 2015 18:42:52 +0530","newspaper":"BBC"},{"title":"Funding an art renaissance in the US","content":"US art museums took a knock in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and attendances continue to fall. But some major investments and new approaches to fundraising have helped them rebound. On an unseasonably warm day in January, as the price of oil dropped by 50%, a group of Texans gathered at a swanky New York restaurant to present a multi-million dollar plan for the redevelopment of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston.There were a number of jokes about the impact of oil prices on the portion sizes offered by the restaurant - two salad leaves and a pea, however artfully placed on a teaspoon of green mousse and a coin sized piece of fish, do not make a meal in Texas.But there was no joking about the importance of art to Houston's economy, which is fuelled by oil and energy and has been rocked by the plunge in prices.The city hopes the new campus, with its world class collections, international art school and conservation centre, will help attract the type of workers it needs to diversify and sustain future growth.\"Building a green park of two acres in a downtown city - that's meaningless today,\" says Texan pipeline tycoon Rich Kinder, one of the richest men in America with a personal net worth estimated at $11.9bn (\u00a38bn).\"This is a massive extension of the south west's largest museum of fine arts, but it's also much more than that. It's transformational for Houston.\" US Art FundingIndividual philanthropy remains the strongest source of support for art museums in the US. In 2013 museums were given six times as many works of art as they purchased.Endowments, trusts and foundations provide 28% of art museum funding.  The government funds 6% and corporate giving accounts for just 4%.Visitors spend an average of $8 when they go to a museum.Each visitor costs the museum an average of $53 in terms of investment.Figures from the Association of Art Museum DirectorsAlmost all the $350m cost of the project has been met by wealthy individuals, including Mr Kinder, who is chairman of the museum's board of trustees. He donated $50m. Due to be completed by 2019, the museum campus is expected to generate $334m in economic activity over 20 years. That's in line with a new report from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), a government grant-making agency, which says arts and culture contribute almost $700bn to the US economy, outperforming the construction industry. The sector also employs some 4.7 million workers, and for every 100 jobs created by demand for the arts, 62 jobs are created in other areas.On the downside, the report also shows that museum, gallery and theatre attendances are continuing to fall. According to the NEA, the vast majority of Americans \"consume\" the arts online and only 21% actually visit art museums.  \"But we do ourselves a disservice when we look at only one measure of engagement with the arts,\" says NEA chairman Jane Chu. \"Our reports show that the arts are a formidable presence in America and the ways in which people participate are expanding.\"\n                        Baltimore Museum of Art uses special events to encourage children to visit\n                    \n                She says technology provides an early entry point to the arts which may peak interest in live performances and trips to museums. But institutions need to find new ways to engage with audiences and become more relevant to their communities, she adds.\"Museums were founded years ago on the idea that they were treasure troves or libraries of objects. Today they have to be destinations for people to have experiences that they can create and be a part of,\" says Doreen Bolger, director of the Baltimore Museum of Art in Maryland.The museum has an international reputation and holds the largest collection of works by Henri Matisse. It is supported by a $100m endowment that enables it to offer art making days for local families, outreach programs for city schools, and interactive mobile phone tours for visitors. In 2006 it introduced free admission.'Financially stable'\"We were of course affected by the 2008 downturn because all of our diverse [revenue] sources were affected. But our trustees and donors have been truly astounding. \"Our funding from them was sustained throughout the downturn and many people increased their giving when the museum went free. They felt it was important to provide that for the community,\" says Ms Bolger.Endowments remain the most significant source of museum revenue, but new figures from the Association of Art Museum Directors (AAMD) show that funding has become more diversified.Admission fees play a relatively small part, but memberships, foundations and trusts, store purchases and local government funding make important contributions. Corporate donations have fallen.\"Museum attendance dropped off in 2008 and some museums underwent some staffing cuts, cut back a little on programming. They did what they needed to do to weather the storm,\" says AAMD director Christine Anagnos.\"But they're [now] financially stable because they receive their money from a variety of sources,\" she says.\"They're not just relying on one source, whether it's endowment income or earned revenue or corporate memberships. They are really diversified in their revenue streams.\"Oil dependenceIronically, Houston was sheltered from the worst effects of the financial crisis because of its dependence of oil. But today that dependence is making it vulnerable.\n                        Baltimore Museum of Art says community relevance is vital for survival.\n                    \n                \"People will tell you that Houston is not nearly as wedded to energy as it was a generation ago,\" says Rich Kinder.\"We have the largest medical centre in the world, a tremendous port and a number of universities. But [the falling price of oil] still has a definite impact and will have an impact on philanthropic giving.\"But Gary Tinterow, the director of Houston's Museum of Fine Arts, says he doesn't expect any dramatic decline in donations, and philanthropy remains a better bet than public funding.\"There is something very satisfying and secure when you have government support. You know what your budget is each year and you move forward. But as we've seen with the recent downturn, sometimes massive cuts are necessary in order to fill the mandates from the government.\"The Obama administration has proposed a $2m increase to funding for the NEA next year, bringing the total to $148m. The advocacy group Americans for the Arts says that won't meet the needs of the 95,000 non-profit arts organisations and local agencies the NEA helps support.But the good news is that donations to the arts were up by almost 8% in 2013, according to the latest figures from Indiana University, which tracks charitable giving. The total, $16.66bn, is now touching pre-recession levels.Even if Americans don't go to museums as much as they used to, they clearly think the arts are important enough to support.\n    ","pubdate":"Wed, 08 Apr 2015 05:05:22 +0530","newspaper":"BBC"},{"title":"Latin America's wake-up call on global school tests","content":"\n                        Chile is the top-performing Latin American country in both OECD and Unesco school tests\n                    \n                There have been concerns that the quality of education has been stagnant in too many countries across Latin America.This is a major problem in a globalised economy, where rewards go to the most highly-skilled and most productive workers, and where there is more importance than ever attached to high-quality education.But how do we measure the quality of education in Latin America against global standards if there is an unwillingness to take part in international tests? How can would-be reformers compare results across international borders?Among the most widely recognised international comparisons are the Pisa tests - the Programme for International Student Assessment - conducted every three years by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).In Latin America, the regional rankings of these international tests taken by 15 year olds in maths, reading and science, are headed by diminutive Chile, ahead of economic powerhouses like Brazil and Mexico.But most countries remain off the ranking completely.Missing the testsPart of the reluctance for many Latin American countries might be a fear of being compared with world leaders in education like Finland and Japan. Even Chile, the highest ranking country in the region, is considerably below the global average for these tests, with the average in the Pisa tests being countries such as the UK and France.Latin America: Countries in Pisa testsChile\n51st (out of 65 countries and regional education systems)\nMexico\n53rd\nUruguay\n55th\nCosta Rica\n56th\nBrazil\n58th\nArgentina\n59th\nColombia\n62nd\nPeru\n65th\nSource: OECD\n\nBut the Pisa exam has also generated significant controversy over its methodology and design, leading to concerns - common to many standardised tests - that it does not adequately measure the quality of instruction. Or that it does not truly capture the diversity of contexts facing such different school systems.These concerns are reflected in the fact that fewer than half of Latin American countries currently participate.But there are other tests that can provide a global scale for measurement. Unesco's Third Regional Comparative and Explanatory Study (TERCE) covers a much larger part of the region. This has evaluated 15 countries, including Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, and Colombia, as well as smaller participants such as Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala, the Dominican Republic and Uruguay. \n                        Unesco's tests measure pupils in countries such as Guatemala against international standards\n                    \n                The assessment also has a broader range than Pisa, looking at children at different stages of development (at the ages of eight and 11), and evaluating the context of each school.What TERCE found was reason for cautious optimism - but also renewed effort. Its comparison between its last evaluation in 2006 and today showed a modest but broad improvement in test results across the majority of Latin American countries. These rankings were also headed by Chile, followed by Costa Rica and Uruguay. But they also allowed a comparison with countries missing from the Pisa tests, such as Guatemala and Paraguay, which appear in the lower half of the TERCE test scores.Falling behindBut despite - or even because of - the surrounding controversy, these tests have already served an important purpose. Whatever their flaws, they have brought attention to the fact that the massive expansion of access to education in the region, a major victory in itself, isn't sufficient without an equal improvement in quality. \n                        Uphill struggle: Peru is at the bottom of the Pisa rankings, but midway on the Unesco scale\n                    \n                No longer can policymakers ignore the reality that even Latin America's best performing countries, much less its average ones, are far behind the developed world, and far behind where they need to be to compete in the global economy. A student from Honduras or Paraguay is competing for jobs with graduates in Singapore and South Korea.

Latin America's education systems spend nearly as much as the OECD average, with some spending as much as 6% of GDP, while producing lacklustre results.More funding is in some cases necessary, but without a rigorous and targeted approach to ensure that it is spent well, the extra money may just be wasted.That's why a new conversation is needed in Latin America, one that focuses on innovative ways to improve quality - and quickly.A wave of new participants - social entrepreneurs, private businesses, investment funds, foundations, and advocacy groups - are taking the lead in introducing new pedagogies, new technologies, and structural reforms in their education systems.And projects like Pisa and TERCE are helping to put these issues front and centre on the public policy agenda.The next generation of students has little time to lose.

Most are tourists looking up in awe at the LED screens that dominate the landscape.  Nobody notices the tiny dark figure 350 feet above the pavement clinging to the side of the century old Times Building, home of the New Year's Eve Ball.Jeff Rolfe is a cross between Spider Man and Guy Fawkes, gingerly making his way up and down the side of the building with a bitter winter wind attacking him from every angle as he dangles. In his arms are pre-configured wooden racks full of small explosives. He has to install enough to put smiles on a billion TV viewers worldwide. Thankfully these are the finishing touches to a display of fireworks that in just over 24 hours will hopefully also elicit oohs and aahs from a million New Years Eve revellers in the Square. \n                        Jeff Rolfe on top of One Times Square\n                    \n                Short but sweetFor almost everyone the thrill of fireworks is an experience that can be traced back to childhood. Yet if you were able to time travel backwards two, three or four decades into history and stand once again in front of your local town display, you would likely be  disappointed. Mr Rolfe, from Fireworks By Santore, says few people realise that fountains, rockets, wheels and bursts have all taken a huge step forward thanks to technology.\"The shows used to be much much longer, over an hour in duration. But attention spans are shorter now,\" he says.\"Today, 30 minutes is considered a very long display. Technicians used to manually shoot big shells from steel tube mortars that would need to cool down before the next ones could be fired. It was more relaxed. Now we shoot multiple smaller shells per second from several locations, remotely.\"\n                        Fireworks are something most of us learn to love as children. This group is celebrating July 4th in 1940 with sparklers\n                    \n                \n                        The fireworks at the closing ceremony of the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984 might leave modern audiences slightly underwhelmed\n                    \n                Songs were played in their entirety rather than the mixed snippets that are favoured today. And any notion of syncing the beats to the bursts was usually a happy accident rather than anything pre-planned.New software and hardware means shells and cannons can be fired remotely up to two miles away and timed to within 1\/100th of a second. And in a world full of giant LEDs, laser beams and light shows, fireworks are frequently asked to become team players, which is why \"syncing\" is one of the most sought after skills in the industry.\"Using computer software, we mark where we want the highs and lows of the display to be in relation to the music,\" says Mr Rolfe. \"And then we backtrack all the timings, and create digital cues alongside the music track for the firing sequence in an FSK (Frequency Shift Keying) file. When you hear it, it sounds like the noise made by an old modem.\"\n                        The fireworks business has always been dangerous - these men are making fireworks by hand for King George V's coronation celebrations in 1911\n                    \n                \n                        Health and safety has come a long way since 1929, when these women were pictured in France\n                    \n                Like clockworkBig events, especially those on live TV are usually produced using \"timecode\".  A highly accurate digital clock signal is generated from a central source and every person, computer, device and camera at the event uses it as their only time reference. Music tracks, lighting and fireworks can be pre-programmed digitally to flow together perfectly.But it can take months of work by specialist designers to produce a dazzling display. One thing on their side is that the chemical compounds have become more sophisticated.  The colours are brighter, the variety of effects has greatly increased and there is far less residual smoke that once might have blocked subsequent bursts.\n                        Fireworks have become ubiquitous at sporting events - here during the opening ceremony for the 2015 Cricket World Cup in New Zealand\n                    \n                Fireworks today are so chemically precise and stable, a horizontal rocket with a label that says 60 feet will shoot off a building straight out exactly 60 feet, and predictably reach its peak explosion right at the end of that distance without letting gravity pull it down prematurely. Of course timecode and technology are not always perfect, and when things go wrong the motto invented for the digital age - \"all or nothing\" definitely applies. Perhaps the most famous incident was the 2012 Big Bay Boom display in San Diego, which saw about 18 minutes worth of fireworks explode in just 15 seconds thanks to a timecode issue. It could have been the most expensive fireworks display ever (on a per second basis). But firework displays that often cost cities as much as a teacher's annual salary have an upside - successful or not.Officials in San Diego worked out their firework display fiasco still generated about $10m in revenue from local restaurants, tourism, boat hires, and hotel stays. And accidents don't happen as much these days. The biggest problem with older displays was explosions due to sparks from other fireworks in the display. Now the devices are smaller and more spread out so it doesn't happen as often.\n                        Accidents at modern events are now rare - this traditional display however is created by throwing molten metal against a cold wall in Nuanquan, Hebei province, China to celebrate the Spring Festival\n                    \n                Corporate communicationsCorporate requests often drive the direction of the fireworks industry. Companies are increasingly asking for daytime fireworks which have been around for years, but now look much better because once again there are brighter colours and cleverer chemical combinations which make them more dramatic against a bright blue backdrop.\n                        Flogos are created using a portable bubble container, and allow you to create airborne company logos\n                    \n                Despite the many developments one request that is harder than you'd think is to reproduce corporate logos. Mr Rolfe acknowledges that static logos are easy to do. But firing words and exact shapes from the ground into the sky with 100% accuracy for the entire audience to read from different vantage points is an art form that's in its infancy. \"We are just starting to work with it. The new firing systems allow us to shoot from the same location over and over again to basically form line art. It's not a cheap effect. It takes a bit of trial and error to get the sizing right but when it's done right it's pretty incredible.\"Other companies offer a variation of ways to reproduce airborne corporate designs closer to the ground, such as Flogos, which are made in a portable bubble container and sent off into the sky at a rapid pace.\n                        The view from the top: This is the angle the public doesn't see\n                    \n                \n                        The preparations go on, far above the heads of revellers\n                    \n                But Mr Rolfe believes the future of fireworks is solid. Despite the rising costs of insurance, security, transportation and storage he thinks that beautiful explosions in the sky will never be trumped by holograms or video screens or anything else.Everyone over five loves sparks and sparkle.\n    ","pubdate":"Tue, 07 Apr 2015 04:32:24 +0530","newspaper":"BBC"},{"title":"Brazil\u2019s burger king likes his companies lean","content":"\n                        Jorge Paulo Lemann is head of 3G Capital\n                    \n                Brazil's richest man Jorge Paulo Lemann does not eat burgers. A former tennis player, who competed in Wimbledon in the 1960s, he is an advocate of healthy eating.But when it comes to business it appears he has a rather different appetite, one that stretches to ready meals and processed foods.His company 3G Capital - which already owned Heinz and Burger King - bought the US food giant Kraft last month, in partnership with billionaire investor Warren Buffett.\nTheir firms have discipline, high productivity and low waste - qualities many companies in Brazil are still lacking today\nThe products may have a tendency to stretch your waistline, but Lemann, who was born in Rio de Janeiro, is obsessed with lean companies.In late 2008, barely months after acquiring Anheuser-Busch, makers of Budweiser beer, Lemann and his associates overhauled the company, shedding 1,400 jobs, some 6% of its workforce.In one year, 3G Capital found $10bn in savings and divestments.Executives lost all sorts of privileges: walls were torn down and personal offices were joined together in open plan spaces. The number of company Blackberries issued to employees fell from 1,200 to 720.Freebies like free baseball tickets, free beer or first-class tickets were cut. Private jets belonging to Anheuser-Busch were sold.\"They take cost-cutting very seriously,\" says Cristiane Correa, a journalist and author of Dream Big, a book on the rise of Lemann and his two fellow countrymen and partners Marcel Telles and Beto Sicupira.\"Some people get really scared by that. Afterwards, of course, the company grows and they end up hiring again, but at start it is ugly.\"Desire to get richCost-cutting is one of 3G Capital's obsessions. But there are others too, such as meritocracy and investing in the right people.Some of 3G Capital's top executives that today are in charge of leading global brands have been with Lemann since the early days of Garantia - the bank he founded in the 1970s.Back then, the magnate had already coined the term PSD to describes his ideal employees: \"Poor, Smart, with a Deep Desire to Get Rich.\" Marcel Telles, one of 3G's three strongmen and with a net fortune estimated upwards of $13bn, started out his career as a sort of office boy in Garantia.One trait that is conspicuously absent in 3G Capital's business model is innovation.\n                        3G Capital owns Burger King\n                    \n                The company makes its fortunes by finding optimum ways of producing something simple - like a burger or ketchup - and repeating that formula on a larger scale, without requiring much creativity.\"This model is well-suited to the food industry, where you can make a lot of money if you are disciplined enough to avoid waste when producing,\" says Leni Hidalgo, a professor at Brazil's Insper business school, who worked in one of Lemann, Telles and Sicupira's businesses in the 1990s.Last month's Heinz-Kraft merger turned Lemann into a food tycoon, now leading the third largest food and beverage conglomerate in the US.Brazil - from hype to slowdown:In the 2000s:Massive offshore oil discovered20 million people lifted from povertyAchieved investment grade rating in credit agenciesWon bids to host Olympics and World CupNow:Austerity measures and spending cutsLarge scale Petrobras corruption scandal0.1% GDP growth in 2014Rising inflation (7.7% compared with a target of 4.5%) and unemployment (5.9% up from 4.8% in January 2014)Currency close to its lowest point in 12 years - $1 is worth almost twice as much as five years agoIt has been almost a decade since the business world saw the rise of another ambitious Brazilian - mining tycoon Eike Batista.For much of the past 10 years, Batista - a flashy maverick with an extravagant lifestyle - was the world's seventh richest billionaire, and seen by many as the international face of Brazil's then vibrant economic growth on the world stage.Much of Batista's wealth was made during a cycle of high commodity prices. But once that cycle came to an end, a mixture of economic downturn and bad decisions meant he lost much of his lustre and fortune.Discreet lifestyleIn a way, Batista's story is a chronicle of Brazil's journey from hype to economic downturn, in which the fortunes of South America's largest country roughly followed the same timescale.Now the subject of a series of criminal charges his fall from grace was absolute, while Lemann claimed the post of Brazil's richest person.Many commentators see him as the \"anti-Batista\" - a prudent manager with a low profile and discreet lifestyle who is not given to grandiose statements.\n                        The maker of Budweiser is also owned by 3G Capital\n                    \n                But just as with Batista in the 2000s, Lemann now seems like an appropriate choice to be the \"face\" of Brazil's tougher economic reality in 2015.His philosophy of cost-cutting and efficiency savings is currently in vogue in his home country - as the government turns to austerity measures in a bid to put the Brics nation back on a path of sustainable growth.But Prof Hidalgo says 3G Capital is, in many ways, the opposite of the typical Brazilian industry. Their firms have discipline, high productivity and low waste - qualities many companies in Brazil are still lacking today.\"Brazilian businesses have much to learn from them,\" says the professor.\n                        Eike Batista has lost much of his fortune\n                    \n                Brazil's government must surely be hoping that the country's fortunes also mirror one of its most successful sons.\n    ","pubdate":"Tue, 07 Apr 2015 05:24:31 +0530","newspaper":"BBC"},{"title":"How much? The crazy cost of children's parties","content":"Installing a temporary ice rink in your home and inviting replicas of the Disney on Ice team to perform, may seem a bit over-the-top for a child's fifth birthday party.But this is exactly what one client asked luxury events firm Quintessentially Events &amp; Weddings to organise.\nIf you don't do a big party you're not a bad parentProf Bill Doherty, Birthdays Without Pressure\nFor another child's winter birthday, the firm created \"a bringing the outside in\" themed party, which involved installing an indoor lawn complete with trees, flowers, swings and slides.The price tag for events like this can stretch to a dizzying \u00a3100,000, says event manger Chloe Astin.After all, cocktails and canap\u00e9s for the adults, and party bags including tiny Tiffany necklaces for the kids, don't come cheap.Party inflationBut I can't be alone among parents feeling that this pressure to throw ever-more-fancy parties for our kids and their increasingly hard-to-impress friends is getting out of control.My son is just five but has already been to actress-led drama parties; a pizza making session in a restaurant kitchen; a T-shirt printing workshop; and even a theme park hotel sleepover. Will there be no end to this party inflation?\n                        One parent tried to get the Disney on Ice team to perform for their child's fifth birthday\n                    \n                Quintessentially says it has seen an undoubted increase in extravagant requests. \"What kids are watching and digesting is giving them higher expectations,\" says Ms Astin.Alice in WonderlandOften the children involved are too young to have any expectations at all.Steven Duggan, founder of his eponymous events firm, which counts pop stars Sir Elton John and Leona Lewis as clients, says he has seen increased demand for parties aimed at children aged three and under.He recently organised a \u00a370,000 event with a joint Peter Pan and Alice in Wonderland theme, including fairground rides and entertainers. \n                        Guests were invited to \"walk the plank\" at a party with Peter Pan and Alice in Wonderland themes\n                    \n                \n                        The joint-themed party to celebrate the birthday of one-year-old twins cost \u00a370,000\n                    \n                \n                        The price included props such as these colourful giant mushrooms\n                    \n                All this was to celebrate the first birthday of twins - an occasion which he concedes was more a celebration of the children than for them.Using his services to arrange a child's special day usually costs between \u00a315,000 and \u00a320,000. But he says he can organise something \"a level up from what you would do yourself\" from \u00a35,000.Ostentatious kids' parties such as these are relatively rare. Quintessentially organises a maximum of two a year, while Mr Duggan says he organises between five and eight.Hollywood howlersYet even at the more normal end of the scale, many parents are spending more on their child's special day.The Young Film Academy, whose main business is running film making courses for young people, organised 150 children's film parties last year, up from 120 in 2013. While prices start at \u00a3540, almost half of the bookings were for its most expensive MoviePartie starting at \u00a31,950, which stars the birthday child and their friends in a Hollywood-style epic\n                        At Young Film Academy children can star in their own Hollywood-style film\n                    \n                \"There's a real sense from parents that they want to do something different from the usual parties,\" says director James Walker.The fragmented nature of the party market - which includes cake, hall hire and entertainment - makes costs difficult to monitor. But insurer LV's latest annual survey of the cost of raising a child from birth until 21 put the total at \u00a3229,951, with its \"other\" category - which includes birthday and Christmas presents, as well as driving lessons - increasing by 60.2% between 2003 and 2015.On average, parents spend \u00a3135 on their child's party, with one-in-six parents admitting to splashing out over \u00a3300, according to parenting website Netmums.Given that there are nearly eight million families with dependent kids in the UK, the party market could be worth nearly \u00a31.1bn.Affluenza?Of course, having a few friends over for cake does not cost that much, but then that's rarely on the agenda these days.While a mother billing a five-year-old \u00a315.95 for failing to attend her child's birthday party made the headlines earlier this year, the fact the party was at a dry ski slope went largely unremarked.Yet it's a good example of how children's parties have become less simple affairs. \n                        The days of jelly and ice-cream in the back garden appear to be over\n                    \n                The trend seems to be part of what author Oliver James termed \"affluenza\" - an epidemic of obsessive, envious, keeping-up-with-the-Joneses.Sarah Ockwell-Smith, mother-of-four and founder of the Gentle Parenting website, says the media circus surrounding celebrities has helped to push the party bar higher. But ultimately, the motivation to make a big deal out of relatively minor milestones all stems from the parents, she believes.As she points out, a young child can often find all the fuss and attention overwhelming, resulting in tears of exasperation rather than tears of joy.Her advice to parents is to \"think about who you're doing it for and what will make your child happy.\"\n                        Young children often don't react to a big event in the way their parents expect\n                    \n                Present-free birthdays?Bill Doherty, professor of Family Social Science at the University of Minnesota, founded US group, Birthdays Without Pressure, for precisely these reasons.He says the group stemmed from local parents' dissatisfaction with the escalation of children's birthday parties, and a sense that parents were creating the problem themselves.He credits the group with having \"some influence\" in the growth of \"present free\" birthdays in the US - the invitation makes it clear there are to be no gifts, or that a donation to charity should be made instead.But he cautions that the idea only works if all the parents agree collectively not to have party bags or presents.\n                        Not all children will appreciate a present-free birthday\n                    \n                Not making this crystal clear can have unfortunate consequences.One member of his group hosted a party where one invitee who didn't receive a goody bag declared the party \"a rip off\", prompting the birthday girl to burst into tears.He says it's also important to be honest with a child about the reasons for not having presents,.Other group members suffered the humiliation of having neighbours fundraise to pay for a party they thought the parents couldn't afford.\"It's about giving parents permission to simplify their plans to fit with their family values,\" says Prof Doherty. \"There isn't just one way to do this. \"If you don't do a big party you're not a bad parent.\"\n    ","pubdate":"Mon, 06 Apr 2015 04:31:09 +0530","newspaper":"BBC"}]}
