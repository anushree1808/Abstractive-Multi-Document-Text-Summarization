{"root":[{"title":"Airtel, Idea, RCOM drop on fears of fierce bidding","content":"Biswajit Baruah, ET Bureau Mar 28, 2015, 04.07AM IST(Reflecting the mood, analysts\u2026) MUMBAI: Shares of telecom companies such as Bharti Airtel, Idea Cellular and Reliance Communications (RCOM) dropped more than 5% on Friday on fears of aggressive bidding for airwaves, a development that may exert pressure on companies' balance sheets and cash flow, and restrict their expansion plans. Reflecting the mood, analysts maintained a cautious outlook on the sector, saying fresh buyers should stay away from this space in the near-term. On Friday, the department of telecommunications (DoT) released details of bidders at the recently concluded airwaves auction, where the government mopped up Rs 1.1 lakh crore from the spectrum put up for auction. The prices for the spectrum were considerably higher than the reserve price, said analysts. \"Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular have paid a little more for the spectrum than what the markets were expecting,\" said Mayuresh Joshi, VP, (institutional) Angel Broking. \"Going forward, Reliance Jio's pricing for its services would be closely watched. However, investors should note that the overhang on telecom stocks over spectrum is probably over.\" Telecom stocks came under intense selling pressure on Friday \u2014 Bharti Airtel fell 5.64% to Rs 376. Idea Cellular dropped 4.96% to Rs 171 after touching new 52-week high of Rs 187 in early trade. RCOM touched a new 52-week low of Rs 56.90 before closing at Rs 58.25, down 3.56%, while Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) ended 1.54% lower at Rs 7.68. Shares of some telecom companies \u2014 Bharti Airtel, Idea Cellular \u2014 have had a good run in the past one year, gaining 21% and 23%, respectively, while Reliance Communications dropped 53%; all these stocks have underperformed the ET 100 Index which gained nearly 27% over the same period. \"We reiterate our cautious view on the telecom sector, given the stretched balance sheets, rising capital expenditure, regulatory pushback, Reliance Jio's launch overhang, and expensive valuations,\" said Vinay Jaising, analyst at Morgan Stanley. They are also sceptical of Indian telecom companies due to a number of structural issues such as cannibalisation of voice by data, rapid expansion and network operational cost to deliver data, pricing impact from the imminent entry of Reliance Jio, and stretched balance sheets due to spectrum prices. \"Telcos will further bloat their balance sheet with debt, which is already under severe strain. We maintain 'hold' rating for Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular with a price target of Rs 399 and Rs 167\/share, respectively,\" said Amar Mourya, research analyst at IndiaNivesh. Most telecom companies may report negative free cash flow in 2015 as they are required to pay a quarter of the committed amount in the spectrum auction upfront, and the rest will be paid in installments over 10 years from 2017.","pubdate":"Sat, 28 Mar 2015 04:07:22 +0530","newspaper":"Economic Times"},{"title":"Sustained growth makes Kajaria Ceramics a good long-term bet","content":"Narendra Nathan, ET Bureau Jan 26, 2015, 08.00AM IST(Analysts say Kajaria Ceramics\u2026) We recommended Kajaria Ceramics a year back because of its high growth rate and decent valuations. The company has rewarded its investors by outperforming the benchmark index, Sensex, handsomely during this time. Kajaria Ceramics continues to grow at a fast pace. It has reported a 30 per cent growth in revenue in the third quarter of 2014-15 compared to the same quarter previous year. The net profit jumped 55 per cent because of a 29 per cent increase in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, and a fall in interest cost due to reduction in debt.  Analysts say Kajaria Ceramics will maintain its high growth in the coming years, largely because of conducive industry dynamics. For the past several years, the Indian tiles industry has been growing due to urbanisation, affordability of tiles, and consumers' focus on home aesthetics, aided by rising disposable incomes. This growth rate is expected to accelerate in the coming years because of the new government's increased focus on affordable housing and the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. Going by its performance, Kajaria should be able to beat the industry growth rates. In the next five years, Kajaria Ceramics is aiming to grow its revenue at a compound annual growth rate of 20 per cent. Close to 15 per cent of this growth will come from an increase in volume. The remaining will be a result of an increase in prices and a customer shift to premium brands. Kajaria Ceramics is also expanding capacity. It will be spending up to Rs 200 crore in the next fiscal year towards this purpose. Though the company will continue to focus on its tiles business, which accounts for 90 per cent of its turnover, it has entered the sanitaryware and sanitary-fittings segment. Its sanitaryware plant is already operational and is expected to reach full production by March 2015. Even though margins are expected to remain at the current 15 per cent-plus level, the fall in the natural gas price will bring down costs and should help the entire sector expand margins. The historical PE of 35 may appear high, but analysts say, because of the strong volume growth, pricing power, healthy margins and a strong balance sheet\u2014very low debt, which is being cut further\u2014it is justified. But, bear in mind, the company, and the entire Indian tiles industry, faces a threat from Chinese imports. Any policy shift that serves to boost tiles export from China, will adversely impact the entire industry, including Kajaria.

These companies are unlikely to reap the full impact of the festive season in the December 2014 quarter. The festive sales were split between September and December due to early Navratri and Diwali in 2014. Along summer and an early festive season led to a strong first half for these companies, giving many investors an impression that the demand has bounced back for discretionary products post-election. A base effect, thanks to lower sales in the year-ago period, also boosted the numbers and fuelled sentiment.  There was a growth of 27-57% in sales for the September quarter and 25-39% in the first half of FY15. The earnings growth figures were even higher. The result was a surge in stock prices (See table). But, random checks (while talking to dealers and mall outlets) suggest that the sales in the December quarter have been less than impressive. One spots a similar trend in other consumer discretionary sectors like passenger vehicles and two-wheelers. For instance, Hero Moto reported minus 2% growth YoY for the December quarter, Bajaj Auto recorded minus 1% growth YoY while M&amp;M closed the quarter minus 12% YoY growth. Maruti was an exception, generating a 12% growth YoY. While analysts are justifying current high valuations \u2014 claiming that these companies will benefit from the correction in steel, copper and aluminium prices \u2014 a weak sales growth may keep sentiments sombre.","pubdate":"Tue, 13 Jan 2015 05:14:13 +0530","newspaper":"Economic Times"},{"title":"Balkrishna Industries: A long-term bet after the recent correction","content":"Narendra Nathan, ET Bureau Jan 5, 2015, 08.00AM IST(Balkrishna Industries\u2026) The profits of Balkrishna Industries fell by around 40% after reporting poor numbers in the second quarter of 2014-15. The tyre company's net profit went down by 17% compared to the corresponding period last year and by 22% compared to the preceding quarter. Lower volume from European markets (the region contributes around 50% of its sales volume) and the discounts offered to clients to compensate the fall in natural rubber prices are the primary factors behind the fall in net profit.  Balkrishna Industries could not take advantage of the lower prices of natural rubber in the second quarter because it had a huge inventory of rubber purchased at higher prices. Rising employee costs following partial commissioning of its new tyre plant with 1.5 lakh per annum capacity in Bhuj, Gujarat, was another factor. The recent correction in its price has brought the valuations of Balkrishna Industries to reasonable levels. In addition to the fall in price, analysts are getting bullish on this niche player because of its improving fundamentals. Its Bhuj plant is expected to become fully operational by April 2015. This will help the company to foray into much bigger radial tyres (expected to move up from 35 inches to 57 inches) and, therefore, its tyre portfolio will be more comprehensive. Radial tyres have higher realisations (3-4% higher) and with this new plant, its radial sales volume is expected to move up from around 30% now to above 40% over the next three years. Balkrishna Industries is also working towards increasing its global market share in the off -highway tyres (OHT) from 5% to 8% in the next three years. To realise this goal, the company plans to set up warehouses in the US and other overseas markets in the near future to increase its penetration levels. Though the global fall in agricultural product prices has resulted in less demand for new tractors (lower demand for OEM tyres), existing tractors continue to work (normal demand for tyres in the replacement segment , which is nearly 80% of its total sales volumes). New tractor sales are also expected to improve following the stability in the American farm sector reported recently. With around 90% of its revenues coming from exports, Balkrishna Industries will also benefit from the sudden depreciation of the rupee in the last six months.

Orient Cement's per tonne cement production cost is around 13% lower than the industry average. Therefore, the company could repeat its stellar performance in the third quarter of 2014-15 as well. In its second quarter sales, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) and net profit grew by 20%, 123% and 200%, respectively, compared to the corresponding period last year, or on a year-on-year basis. The company could also improve its third quarter EBITDA per tonne to `785, which is among the highest in the industry. The rise in EBITDA per tonne was due to the strong volume growth (up by 4% y-o-y) and improvement in realisations (up by 15% y-o-y). Orient Cement is a good long-term bet because of the infrastructure growth expected in the company's two key markets\u2014Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh\u2014in the coming years. Industrial demand is expected to pick up in Maharashtra following the initiatives by the new state government. Andhra Pradesh, however, is the best example of the amount of harm political uncertainties can do to even well-established companies. The market size of cement has shrunk to 13 million tonnes in the state from the peak levels of 18 million tonnes in 2008-09. However, due to the low cost of production, Orient Cement could increase its market share.  Cement consumption should jump in Andhra Pradesh in the coming years as massive construction projects are lined up at the new state capital. To benefit from this, the mid-sized cement company is in the process of increasing capacity through green-field and brown-field projects. The company's 3 million tonne green-field project in Gulbarga (northern Karnataka) is progressing smoothly. Its trial production and, subsequently, commercial production is expected from April 2015 and June 2015, respectively. This project also includes a 45MW thermal plant and a 7MW waste-heat-recovery plant. Despite the key advantages, such as low-cost cement production, high return on equity (ROE) and return on capital employed (ROCE), this stock is still attractively priced compared to its peers.

While its net profit rose by 50% year-on-year, it zoomed by 98% on a quarter-on-quarter basis. The rise in net profit was primarily due to two factors: first, there was a 316% y-o-y jump in its other income which was triggered by the profit it made from sale of investments. Second, the company reported 14% y-o-y increase in rating revenues, which was significantly higher than the 5% achieved by its main competitor Crisil during the period under consideration. In addition to the increase in surveillance income, Care also added 761 clients during the quarter and its total volume of debt instruments rated increased by 16% y-o-y.  Analysts are now getting bullish on the long-term (2-3 years) growth opportunities for the credit rating sector because it is best placed to benefit from the cyclical recovery in corporate capex and bank credit growth. The sector is already doing well because of the pickup in debt issuances in the recent past. According to Prime Database, debt placements during the first half of 2014-15 went up by 22% compared to the corresponding period last year. Another factor helping credit rating agencies is the improvement in credit environment. For example, Care's modified credit ratio (MCR) has improved from 1.05 times to 1.25 times in the second quarter, y-o-y. MCR is calculated by dividing the number of rating upgrades with downgrades. An increase in MCR means that the financials of the rated companies are stable and improving. With a turnaround in the economy, MCR is expected to improve further in the second half of 2014-15. With the revival in market sentiments, debt issuances are expected to rise manifold, increasing business opportunities for rating agencies like Care. Since the company provides 'grading' for equity public offerings, revival in stock market sentiments also bodes well for it. While analysts are bullish on the sector, Care is their preferred choice. This is so because it is the cheapest stock based on valuations and the recent correction has brought down its valuations further to reasonable levels. It is quoting at 35 times trailing price-to earnings ratio compared to 51 times for Crisil and 45 for Icra. Care is also continuing with its liberal dividend policy and has announced 650% dividend during the second quarter, taking the total interim dividend announced in 2014-15 to 710%.

The shares fell to 1,865.5 yen ($17) in the first few minutes of frenzied trading, erasing most of the gains made since the start of the year, in response to Sony's announcement, which came after Japanese  markets had closed Wednesday. The company, whose dual-listed shares slid nearly 7.0 per cent in  New York, blamed the ballooning loss estimate on struggles at its mobile phone business, where it said it would cut staff by 15 per cent, or about 1,000 jobs. Demand for Sony's smartphones has come under increasing pressure from rivals including  Samsung and Apple, which is releasing its newest  iPhone in several key markets, including  Japan, this week. Sony also said it would not pay dividends for the first time since its shares started trading in Tokyo in 1958. The company, whose  credit rating has been slashed to junk, has issued a string of downward earnings revisions over the past two years as it undergoes a sweeping overhaul led by chief executive Kazuo Hirai. The restructuring has included thousands of layoffs, exiting the personal computer business and liquidating assets that saw the $1.0 billion sale of its Manhattan headquarters. News that the company was heading for a 230 billion yen ($2.14 billion) net loss in the fiscal year to March 2015 comes only months after it tipped a shortfall of just 50 billion yen, citing a turnaround in its television unit. The announcement was likely to resurrect fears that what used to be the world's leading electronics company has a lot more work ahead to cast off years of losses. Hirokazu Kabeya, senior strategist at  Daiwa Securities in Tokyo, said the share plunge was inevitable after the firm's latest worrying forecast. \"Market players are getting used to (Sony's downward revisions) but a temporary fall was still unavoidable,\" he said. Sony has been cutting expectations for sales in the money-losing smartphone business amid weaker-than-expected results in emerging markets and the soaring presence of rivals in its home market. \"Other firms are also offering new products with innovative technology -- this business experiences dramatic changes in products and services,\" Hirai told reporters in Tokyo when asked about struggles in the mobile phone unit. \"The environment is changing and becoming more severe,\" he added. Hirai, who took over in 2012, said Wednesday that the firm would continue to focus on more profitable areas of its vast business, which ranges from televisions and portable music to a movie division and little-known insurance business. Despite his bid to slim down the firm, Hirai has repeatedly shrugged off pleas to abandon a money-losing television division, which he insists remains central to Sony's core business. Japanese manufacturers have suffered badly in their TV divisions as razor-thin margins and fierce overseas competition hammered profits. Kabeya at Daiwa Securities said Sony cannot afford to get into a price war with lower-cost rivals, including Chinese smartphone makers, or beat Samsung and  Apple in global market share. \"It is difficult to cut into the dominance of the big two: Samsung and Apple,\" Kabeya said. \"(Sony) would be wise to shift its business resources to where it is strong -- such as movies and music.\" Following Thursday's share price drop, investors may take a step back and see Hirai's efforts to slim down the company as a positive, Kabeya said. \"But it's unlikely we'll see a rapid turnaround and the company will likely continue to go through a difficult time for a while,\" he added.

Nearly a dozen companies have filed draft offer documents with  market regulatorSebi in the last one month for launching IPOs. The Catholic Syrian Bank, Amar Ujala Publications and Prabhat Dairy are among them. Despite a strong rally in the markets following the formation of a stable government at the Centre, companies raised a meagre Rs 3,019 crore from  IPOs in 2014-15. There were no big-ticket markets debuts during the year either. Only eight mainboard IPOs hit the market collectively raising just Rs 2,769 crore in 2014-15. This included only one Rs 1,000-crore plus IPO (Inox Wind--Rs 1,020 crore). The highest-ever mobilization through IPOs was in 2007-08 when companies raised Rs 41,323 crore. Fund-raising from equity markets doubled to hit a five-year high of Rs 58,801 crore in 2014-15 despite a lacklustre showing by IPOs. There has, however, been some improvement on the IPO front with companies turning active in filings from the third week of March. \"The markets are remaining quite strong. The confidence about growth is also still there. So, there would be a revival in the IPO market this year,\" says G Chokkalingam, founder and managing director (MD), Equinomics Research and Advisory. \"There are likely to be more IPOs and mobilization from them would also be higher than the last three to four years,\" says  Pranav Haldea, MD, PRIME Database, which compiles data on the primary capital markets. \"There are a lot of companies where  private equity investors are looking for an exit. If the business is good and valuations are right, companies would get good response from IPOs,\" he says.    But unlike in the past, IPOs will not get overwhelming response from investors, say experts. \"There will be selective investor interest in IPOs,\" Haldea says. Incidentally, the IPO of Adlabs Entertainment managed to scrape through only on its final day last month after it reduced the offer price and extended the offer period by three days. As many as 103 companies, which received approval from Sebi since April 2009 to collectively raise Rs 48,150 crore, allowed these to lapse despite approvals being valid for a period of one year as markets remained lacklustre for nearly three years. In addition, 58 companies which had filed their offer documents with Sebi since April 2009 to collectively raise Rs 17,685 crore withdrew their offer documents. If these 161 companies had been able to hit the market, an additional Rs 65,835 crore, almost the same as the Rs 73,909 crore which was raised in the six-year period, would have been raised.

Both companies \u2014 existing investors in ILFS \u2014 purchased the shares recently after three founder shareholders, State Bank of India,  Central Bank of India and  HDFC Ltd did not subscribe to their rights.

He cannot be quoted as he is not allowed to speak to the media. Officials at Orix Corporation and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority were unavailable for comment.The rights issue, which sought to raise around Rs 750 crore was priced atRs 763 a piece, much less than the previous sale of a 2% stake in the company to LIC in 2014 at Rs 1,100 a share, thus valuing the infrastructure fund company then at $5 billion. \"The valuation has fallen due to the economic slowdown and regulatory hurdles in the infrastructure sector, the primary focus of ILFS,'' the first person with direct knowledge of the deal said.''In general, infrastructure lenders are seeing lower valuation because of the stress in the sector,\" said  Abizer Diwanji, who is national head financial services at EY. \"Infrastructure lending is in a mess and that will have an impact on their valuation.''\"But rights issue is not priced to market.

Federal Reserve  official Jeffrey Lacker repeated on Friday his call for the US central bank to consider hiking  interest rates in June, and said there was no shame in adjusting them lower again if economic data demanded it. Spot gold was flat at $1,206.93 an ounce by 0212 GMT.  Bullion climbed 1.1 percent on Friday as bulls attempted to push the price past the $1,210 resistance level. US gold for June delivery was up 0.2 percent at $1,207.20 an ounce. The timing of the first US rate hike in nearly a decade remains the \"key wildcard\" for gold, said Barnabas Gan,  analyst at OCBC Bank. \"If the Fed rate hike doesn't occur in June and if the (next) labour print doesn't come in as good as the market expects, gold could rise up to $1,250,\" said Gan. US jobs grew at the slowest pace in more than a year in March, sending gold to a seven-week high of $1,224.10 on April 6 amid speculation the Fed could delay the rate increase. Hopes of a delay pushed hedge funds and money managers to raise their bullish bets on COMEX gold futures and options for the second straight week during the week ended April 7, US Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed on Friday. Demand in No. 2 gold consumer China remained tepid with the premium on physical gold on the Shanghai Gold Exchange at just above a dollar over the global spot benchmark on Monday from a small discount late on Friday. The state-run Shanghai Gold Exchange said it was working on launching new price benchmark fixing products. Sources said in February that the bourse would launch a yuan-denominated gold fix this year as China, the world's top  gold producer, seeks to gain more of a say over pricing.

In the international market, platinum is trailing gold at $1,166.50 an ounce against gold's $1,200 an ounce. However, as platinum is not listed on the Indian commodity exchanges, it is difficult to track its price on a daily basis. Till 2002-03, jewellers used to sell platinum at a fixed price.Now each  jeweller has a price of the day and there can be a difference of 4-5% in platinum rates from store to store. With prices dropping just before the May-June wedding season, the demand for the rare metal has risen by almost 8%. However, before you head out to buy, keep the following points in mind.Though the outlook for the metal is bullish, with a price rise of 15 to 20% expected this year, it is a good idea to buy platinum in small proportions to start with. If you are keen on investing in the white metal, you need to procure made-to-order coins and bars. However, they are not easy to sell as there aren't too many ready buyers and the market is not mature enough.  According to  Vaishali Banerjee, Country Manager of Platinum Guild International (India), the price depression is good news for buyers of jewellery. Platinum jewellery is hallmarked\u2014Pt950 denotes 95% purity. The remaining 5% is an alloy of platinum group metals like palladium and rhodium. Banerjee advises buying platinum only from The Platinum Guild International-authorised jewellers, the list of which is mentioned on the guild's website. Platinum products are also authenticated by a third-party certification, the  Underwriters Laboratories, also known as the UL card. Insist on this card from the jeweller to authenticate your purchase.Too high a priceThe making charge of platinum jewellery is around 10-30% more than gold. The more intricate the design, the more it costs to make.\"There is high wastage or manufacturing loss during the making process. As the metal is very dense, it requires highly-skilled workers to make jewellery out of it. A platinum jewellery worker can make gold jewellery, but not vice versa. Also the alloys that go into platinum jewellery are as expensive as platinum. Silver and copper alloy used in gold jewellery are cheaper than gold,\" says  Vastupal Ranka, Director,  Ranka Jewellers (West).Moreover, jewellers are not allowed to make platinum jewellery in-house. According to  Kalpanik Chokshi, Director, Ishwarlal Harjivandas Jewellers, Ahmedabad, platinum jewellery is manufactured by Platinum Guild International. Authorised jewellers have to place an order with the guild to procure a piece. As platinum is a hard metal, it requires a high melting point and can only be handled in specialised manufacturing units.The buyback policy for platinum is similar to that of gold, but there is no standardisation, with each jeweller following his own policy. A hallmarked piece can be exchanged for jewellery or cash at an authorised store.You will get back 85-90% of the value of platinum. In case of gold, the deduction is 0.5%. As a result of the downsides, the demand for platinum is largely concentrated to bigger cities. Even in Mumbai and Pune, less than 1% of all jewellers sell platinum jewellery.The Platinum Guild International (India) is also particular about who can sell the metal.For those attracted to platinum because of its look, a safer option could be white gold, which has a matured market in India. However, the white look of white gold can wear off over time, unlike platinum.The good part about platinum not being traded in India is there is no price speculation around it like in the case of gold. Platinum prices are market driven, and tend to rise slowly.","pubdate":"Mon, 13 Apr 2015 08:00:36 +0530","newspaper":"Economic Times"},{"title":"Dollar gains for 5th straight day","content":"NEW YORK: The  US dollar headed higher against the euro Friday for the fifth straight day, riding on expectations that the US  economy will pick up pace after the winter slowdown.

Now, after a gap of more than a year, government agencies are lining up nearly Rs 40,000 crores of bonds in the next few months, but the yields may be lower by as much as a one-and-a-half percentage points, thanks to falling  interest rates and rising investor appetite for such bonds.  Indian Railways Finance Corporation (IRFC), may obtain the highest allocation of about Rs 15,000-17,000 crore to issue such securities aimed at tapping retail money to meet the country's infrastructure needs.The rate of interest is likely to be in the range of 7-7.25% with a spread or gap of 75-85 basis points below the ten-year benchmark bond yield. These rates are lower than 8.75-9% that such bonds offered in fiscal 2014. However, tax is not payable on the interest earned on such bonds, making them look more attractive than taxable debt instruments. \"Tax-free bonds will evince interest from retail investors, but it has to come at the right time before interest rates slid further,\" said Ajay Manglunia,  senior vice-president at  Edelweiss Securities. \"Any rate above 7% is enough to attract retail investors, who are mostly long-term investors,\" he said. \"Some high net worth individuals too would be investing with an aim for capital appreciation.\"The government has already approved state-owned IRFC and the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI), to sell such bonds.Railway minister Suresh Prabhu has announced ambitious plans to revamp the ailing railways, and has promised even bullet trains. In his Budget speech, he had said that about Rs 1.27 lakh crore would be spent on renovating tracks and other safety measures, and Rs 7.29 lakh crore on capital expenditure next five years. The ministry also intends to fast track the sanctioned works on 7,000 km of double\/third\/fourth lines and commission 1,200 km in 2015-16 at an investment of Rs 8,686 crore.

The target was at 8,500 km in 2014-15. The government is also working on hybrid models to raise funds for these projects since many of the companies in this segment are already sunk in debt.

It is difficult to give a number but there may be a slowdown which may have an effect on oil coming from the U.S. in 2016,\" he said.Birol wants to build stronger ties with emerging economies such as India, China, Indonesia and Mexico and if possible bring  these countries into any joint IEA emergency supply response.IEA's 29 member nations jointly accounted for some 70 percent of global oil demand when it was formed 41 years ago. Now the group accounts for about 50 percent of overall demand as new consumption centers such as India and China have emerged.

They hope it will bring in 10 billion euros ($10.75 billion), half of it from foreign visitors.Some 9 million tickets have already been sold, a third of them outside Italy, for an event seeking to broaden its appeal with interactive exhibits such as a supermarket of the future, cultural events and shows at an arena and an artificial lake.\"Expo will be the litmus test for the great ambitions which Italy has,\" Renzi said in a speech in Milan last month to promote the event. \"With the Expo, we'll be able to see what Italy will be in the coming years.\"Intended as a celebration of Milan's openness to the world and an exploration of new approaches to sustainable food, the event has so far stood out for the chronic corruption and waste that have blighted public works projects in Italy for decades.Several top officials, including the Expo's former public procurement manager, were arrested last year and the whole event was placed under the oversight of the national anti-bribery authority in a bid to ensure transparency.\"REALISTICALLY CONFIDENT\"The Italian pavilion, a centerpiece of the event, was originally expected to cost 63 million euros ($67.69 million) but will end up costing 92 million and may not be completed in time. A number of transport projects planned to accompany Expo will also not be ready.A defendant who opened fire in a Milan court last week, killing three people including a judge, also underlined the potential security problems around a major event of this size.Buffeted by the scandals and facing disputes with architects and building contractors, Expo Commissioner Giuseppe Sala says construction work at the 110-hectare (272 acre) greenfield site on the outskirts of Milan will be essentially complete by opening day.\"I am realistically confident about the work we're doing but I am surprised and sometimes a bit disconcerted by the climate which has developed,\" he told reporters in Milan earlier this month, denying press reports that organizers would be forced to hide embarrassing gaps with camouflage panels.\"When has it ever been the case for a project like an Expo or Olympic Games, that all the building work has been finished 30 days before the opening?\" he said. \"If we end up looking bad, the fault will be mine. The government and local partners have done everything they should.\"CHINA PRESENCEIn all, 145 countries are taking part but China, a growing presence in the Italian economy following a spree of acquisitions ranging from luxury yacht maker Ferretti to tyre maker Pirelli, will be particularly well represented.As well as a 5,000 square meter official pavilion, there are separate halls for property developer Vanke and other Chinese corporations. A million tickets have already been sold in China, adding to a rising flow of Chinese visitors to Italy.\"A Milan delegation went to China two months ago and was given a rapturous welcome,\" said Claudio Artusi, who is coordinating Milan's plans for events across the city.\"Getting visas is a bit of a bottleneck, but the Chinese are keen to have the chance of explaining the country to those who don\u2019t know it.\"  In the noise and confusion of the building site, it is still hard to picture how it will all look, although the intricate woodwork of the Japanese pavilion and the futuristic swoop of France's hall suggest an eye-catching architectural display.Visitors will see exhibits on \"feeding the planet\" with plant samples and technology, while dozens of restaurants will give a taste of various national cuisines including Italian specialties from the upmarket delicatessen chain Eataly.But Expo will also have plenty of room for the mass-produced food industry. Both Coca-Cola and McDonald's are hosting pavilions, fuelling worries that the green-tinged rhetoric of \"sustainability\" will hide a familiar big-money business agenda.A \"No Expo\" movement is already planning protests for the May 1 opening, and even away from anti-globalization groups there has been criticism about the capacity of a mega-spectacle like Expo to promote more eco-friendly agriculture. Slow Food, a campaign group which has done much to promote sustainable and traditional foods, is taking part to press its message against waste and over-industrialized production, but it remains skeptical about many aspects of the event.\"It was absurd to have used 1 million square meters of ground that was not cemented over, that was still fertile, to construct the Expo site,\" said Roberto Burdese, head of the group's Italian section.\"But you can't leave an empty seat at the discussion table. We've decided to be there but it was a very difficult decision.\" ($1 = 0.9307 euros) (Additional reporting by Stephen Jewkes, Ilaria Polleschi; editing by Philippa Fletcher)","pubdate":"Sun, 12 Apr 2015 21:55:20 +0530","newspaper":"Reuters"},{"title":"Volkswagen chairman appears isolated on board after CEO criticism","content":"\n\nBERLIN\/STUTTGART, Germany (Reuters) - Volkswagen Chairman Ferdinand Piech is facing growing resistance within the supervisory board to his criticism of Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn, deepening a leadership crisis at a time when Europe's largest carmaker is struggling to revive profits.   \nPiech on Friday publicly withdrew his confidence in Winterkorn who has been at the helm of the automaker since 2007, telling German magazine Der Spiegel he has \"distanced\" himself from the CEO.Piech's remark, exposing unusual dissent between VW's (VOWG_p.DE) two top leaders, undermines the CEO's prospects of extending his contract beyond 2016 or to become chairman himself when Piech retires, most likely in 2017, analysts said.Wolfgang Porsche, chairman of the Porsche SE (PSHG_p.DE) holding company which controls 51 percent of VW common stock, on Sunday threw his backing behind Winterkorn, siding with the state of Lower Saxony, VW's second largest shareholder and its labor leaders.    \"The comment from Dr Piech represents his personal opinion which has in substance and factually not been coordinated with the family,\" said Porsche, a cousin of Piech and a member of VW's supervisory board.The state of Lower Saxony, where VW is based and which owns one fifth of VW's voting shares, as well as the carmaker's labor leaders who represent half of the 20 members on VW's supervisory board on Friday gave their backing to Winterkorn.Winterkorn, who in his eight-year reign has overseen VW's transformation from a struggling German group saddled with high labor costs into one of the world's most successful automakers, will fight for his job and feels emboldened by support from strong allies, company sources said on Saturday.Piech's remark has plunged VW into turmoil at a time when it is seeking to cut billions of euros of costs to boost profitability at its troubled core division while struggling to forge a long-planned alliance of truck brands and to revive operations in the United States.While the reasons for Piech's campaign remain unclear, a senior labor representative said the chairman had criticized Winterkorn at past board meetings, particularly with regard to the weak U.S. operations.VW's $1 billion plant in Chattanooga has been underutilized for more than a year after demand dried up for the locally-built Passat saloon, a model that Winterkorn had personally lobbied for, a company source said.      \"This falling-out is destabilizing VW at a critical time,\" said London-based Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst. \"The top-level succession is the biggest challenge the carmaker has been facing in the past 20-30 years.\"The supervisory board's steering committee will meet next week to discuss the leadership crisis, another company source said, without being more specific.Besides labor's 10 seats, Lower Saxony has two seats on the 20-member panel, the same as the Porsche family members.

For a change, however, there are reasons for hope in the euro currency bloc, despite still low growth and high unemployment.European Central Bank President Mario Draghi will be able to claim an early success in the bank's fledgling money printing program with figures on Friday set to confirm that falling prices throughout the 19-country euro zone are beginning to stabilize. Bank lending too is improving.\"We're seeing the opposite of 2014,\" said Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING bank. \"Now there are more doubts about the U.S. and China than the euro zone.\"The ECB's long-awaited scheme to buy 60 billion euros a month of chiefly government bonds is also helping to steady nerves in wrangling with debt-strapped Greece.Greece has until mid-week to improve a package of reforms required for the release of euro zone loans that it needs to stay afloat, and that will be a hot topic in Washington.Were Greece to tumble out of the currency union, it could upset an already delicate global picture where even the U.S. economy, a beacon of economic strength, is losing some of its shine.SOBER PROSPECTSOn Tuesday, the United States will release March retail sales data. Although economists expect a rebound, shoppers are being cautious, holding back much of the savings made on lower petrol prices.Consumer inflation, one way of taking the pulse of the economy, has also slowed as oil prices drop.But even stripping out the impact of energy prices and the cost of food, analysts expect only a 0.1 percent month-on-month gain in U.S. consumer prices in March, due on Friday.Such signs of a sagging economy, including disappointingly low hiring last month, are leading investors to bet that the Federal Reserve will wait before hiking the cost of borrowing until October or even December.Many had previously pencilled in a mid-year U.S. rate hike, which will be the first in more than eight years and likely to send ripples around the globe. For many of the central bankers and officials attending the IMF meeting, the later the United States moves to hike rates the better.The IMF's economic outlook report, due early in the week, will likely make for sober reading.China, previously the main growth engine for the world economy, is likely to continue to slow despite two recent interest rate cuts.On Wednesday, the world's second-largest economy will unveil its economic output for the first quarter, alongside readings of factory activity, retail sales and investment.Economists expect growth slowed to 7 percent in January-March. Although far stronger than Europe or the United States, that would increase the chance that China's growth this year will be the weakest in a quarter of a century.  \"We expect to see two more interest rate cuts this year and larger fiscal spending for the economy, but this will not change the fundamental path of slower growth,\" said Xiaojia Zhi, China economist at BofA Merrill Lynch. She pointed to central government efforts to tackle high local government debt and an anti-corruption drive as possible drags on investment.With the euro zone gradually healing, Britain is becoming the focus in Europe as investors brace for volatility in the value of sterling ahead of a tightly contested national election on May 7.The two main parties are close in opinion polls. That makes the outcome unpredictable for a vote that could ultimately determine Britain's future in the European Union, as David Cameron's Conservatives promise a referendum on EU membership if they win.\"The classic safety valve is the currency market.

It owes 80 percent of that debt to official lenders after private bondholders took a hefty writedown in 2012. Since outright debt forgiveness is politically impossible, the next best solution would be for Greece to pay off its expensive IMF loans early, redeem bonds held by the European Central Bank and extend the maturity of loans from euro zone governments to secure lower interest rates for years to come.\"This step would save Greece's budget billions of euros, while reforming the Troika arrangement, eliminating the IMF's and the ECB's financial exposure to Greece,\" said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, who advocates such an arrangement.It would lower the effective interest rate on Greek debt to less than 2 percent, far less than Athens was paying before the euro zone debt crisis began in 2009, and radically reduce the principal amount to be repaid over the next decade, giving Greece fiscal breathing space to revive its economy.And unlike ideas floated by Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis to swap euro zone loans for GDP-linked bonds and ECB holdings with perpetual bonds, paying out the IMF and the ECB early would be legal and supported by precedent. But if the economics make sense for Greece, the politics no longer add up for its partners.A euro zone official said there had been exploratory talks with the previous conservative-led Greek government about such a plan last year, before then Prime Minister Antonis Samaras chose to bring forward an election he lost rather than complete a bitterly unpopular bailout program.\"Now it's a political non-starter,\" said a euro zone official. \"There's just no appetite in the euro zone for a grand bargain to take over Greece's debt to the IMF and the ECB.\"LEVERAGETsipras' denunciations of EU-prescribed austerity, demands for German war reparations and cosying up to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Varoufakis' foot-dragging on reform negotiations and initial calls for a \"haircut\" on Greek debt, have dried up the reservoir of sympathy for Athens. Creditors like Germany, the Netherlands and Finland are bent on keeping the IMF involved as an enforcer of economic reform and fiscal discipline because they don't trust the Greeks to keep their word, nor the European Commission to hold them to it.\"They would prefer to provide debt relief on an annual basis so they keep leverage on Greece to stick to the program,\" said Miranda Xafa, senior scholar at the Centre for International Governance Innovation and a consultant on Greek debt.True, euro zone peers Ireland and Portugal, which received international bailouts after Greece, won EU agreement to pay off their costlier IMF loans faster, raising hopes in Athens.But Dublin and Lisbon were able to do so by borrowing more cheaply from private lenders after completing their bailout programs and regaining access to the capital markets.\"Ireland and Portugal are governments in difficulty, but they are not difficult governments,\" said Elena Daly, principal at EM Conseil, a Paris-based sovereign debt management adviser. Since Greece is stalling on its program and lacks market access, the only way it could pay off 24 billion euros owed to the IMF and redeem 27 billion euros of bonds held by the ECB would be for the euro zone's rescue fund to lend it the money.That in turn would require euro zone governments to convince their parliaments to risk more taxpayers' money than the roughly 170 billion euros they have already lent Greece in two bailouts totalling 240 billion euros.Many economists and euro zone officials believe Athens will anyway need a third bailout of around 30 billion euros this year, even though Tsipras insists Athens does not want that.Euro zone finance ministers promised in 2012 to \"consider further measures and assistance\" to ease Greece's debt provided it stuck to the terms of its program, which it has not done.Both Xafa and Daly said Tsipras had put himself in a near impossible position by making election promises incompatible with keeping the confidence of Greece's creditors.He needs to change the politics fast to have a chance of fixing the economics without resorting to capital controls, paying civil servants with IOUs or defaulting on foreign governments and being forced out of the euro zone, they argue.A referendum asking Greeks if they want to stay in the euro at the price of painful economic reforms, or a quick coalition change to bring in pro-reform centrists, may be his best options, even if they split his Syriza party.Greece's official creditors meanwhile are torn between wanting to keep it in the euro zone to avoid the precedent of a country exiting, and fearing that if Tsipras manages to roll back austerity and secure debt relief, he could embolden like-minded political forces in Ireland, Portugal and Spain. \u00a0\"So they want Greece to prosper and stay in the euro while at the same time wanting the new administration to fall on its face and become an object lesson for other electorates who may be toying with the idea of rebellion,\" Daly said.

Winterkorn, who in his eight-year reign has overseen VW's transformation from a struggling German group saddled with high labor costs into one of the world's most successful automotive companies, will not run away from his job and feels emboldened by support from strong allies, two sources at Wolfsburg-based VW told Reuters on Saturday.A spokesman for Volkswagen declined to comment on the report. Piech's office in Salzburg, Austria, didn't return calls seeking comment.   Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung reported earlier on Saturday that Winterkorn would not allow himself to be edged out of VW, citing unnamed sources at the carmaker who referred to his successful track record as CEO.Under Winterkorn's watch, VW has expanded from eight to twelve brands, more than doubled the number of production plants to over 100 and boosted sales 64 percent to a record 10.1 million vehicles last year.The state of Lower Saxony, where VW is based and which owns a fifth of VW's voting shares, as well as the carmaker's labor leaders who represent half the 20 members on VW's supervisory board on Friday came out backing Winterkorn.Together they have majority control of the panel which appoints and dismisses executives. Important decisions such as the building and shuttering of plants need a two-thirds majority.    Still, VW's chairman has a track record of undermining his own executives. In a Wall St Journal interview published in March 2006, Piech, already chairman of the supervisory board at the time, said it was an \"open issue\" whether the contract of then-CEO Bernd Pischetsrieder would be extended because of opposition from labor representatives.In November 2006, VW announced that Pischetsrieder had agreed to resign, and in 2007 it installed Winterkorn, then a close ally of Piech and head of VW's Audi division.In 2009, Piech publicly damaged the reputation of Porsche CEO Wendelin Wiedeking and chief financial officer Holger Haerter.

They say the shake-up could also help find a buyer among the cooperative banks for troubled Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI) or Carige (CRGI.MI), the two Italian lenders that emerged as the weakest in the European checks.\"The measure has had the effect of an electric shock for the popolari,\" Piero Giarda, chairman of the supervisory board of Banca Popolare di Milano (PMII.MI), told a shareholder meeting on Saturday.  The bank is one of the 10 largest cooperative lenders affected by the reform, which was approved by parliament last month and scraps voting rules giving shareholders one vote each regardless of the size of their stake. The others are UBI (UBI.MI), Banco Popolare (BAPO.MI),  Popolare dell'Emilia Romagna (EMII.MI), Popolare di Vicenza, Veneto Banca, Popolare di Sondrio (BPSI.MI), Credito Valtellinese (PCVI.MI), Popolare di Bari, Popolare dell'Etruria e del Lazio (PEL.MI). Talks over possible tie-ups have already started, at least informally. \"We are talking to the cooperative bank world that has the same problems as us,\" Banco Popolare Chairman Carlo Fratta Pasini told shareholders.\"We're not looking to take over anyone, there are no predators and preys, we're just trying to find out whether there are traveling companions.\"Critics of the \"one-head, one-vote\" rule say it, together with ownership restrictions and limits on proxy voting, have distorted governance at the banks by allowing minority shareholders to block unwanted change. The rules have also long been seen as an obstacle to mergers and to attracting new investors. The expected wave of consolidation will help banks shoulder rising costs as regulators push lenders to increase their loss-absorbing capital, popolari executives say. Some also see domestic tie-ups as a defensive move against possible foreign takeovers. \"Looking for a partner, listed or not listed, is the most logical and safest solution for our future,\" said Gianni Zonin, chairman of unlisted Popolare di Vicenza. He said he hoped regional rival Veneto Banca \"accepts this invitation.\" Both lenders have hired investment banks to advise them on strategic options. They have also written down the value of their shares by 23 percent in an unusual move that is seen as smoothing the way for a possible tie-up.Monte dei Paschi, which is due to carry out a 3-billion euro rights issue to plug a capital shortfall laid bare by last year's review, said on Friday it had been told by the European Central Bank it also needs to find a merger partner. Bankers say UBI would be the most likely domestic candidate to take over the Tuscan bank.Another combination under consideration is between Popolare Milano and Banco Popolare, and possibly also with Popolare Emilia Romagna, according to a source close to the matter. The CEO of Banco Popolare has said Popolare Milano would be his ideal merger candidate. The Milan-based bank declined to comment.

GE stock jumped 8.5 percent.\"The stock has been under-owned by institutional investors, and that's going to change now,\" said Tom Donino, co-head of equity trading at First New York Securities.The repurchase program, which will be partly funded by $35 billion through money returned from GE Capital, is the second-biggest in history after Apple Inc's $90 billion plan. GE, which had 10.06 billion shares outstanding on Jan. 31, said it expected to reduce that by as much as 20 percent to 8 billion to 8.5 billion by 2018.\n        \n        In all, GE said it planned to shed $275 billion in GE Capital assets. That includes the previously announced spinoff of its Synchrony Financial credit card unit, the real estate transaction announced on Friday, and future sales of commercial lending and consumer banking businesses with assets of about $165 billion.The company plans to keep $90 billion in finance assets directly related to selling its products such as jet engines, medical equipment and power generation and electrical grid gear.GE has forecast earnings of $1.70 to $1.80 per share for this year, including 60 cents from GE Capital, but expects profit to be \u201csubstantially higher\u201d in 2018, executives said on a conference call with analysts. Shrinking GE Capital will reduce earnings by 25 cents per share, they said, but the stock buybacks should offset that impact.The company already had a significant number of inquiries about GE Capital units before Friday\u2019s announcement, said Keith Sherin, the finance unit's chief.\n        \n        Blackstone Group LP and Wells Fargo &amp; Co confirmed that they were buying most of the assets of GE Capital Real Estate for about $23 billion.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This is the biggest deal in the commercial property market since Blackstone's acquisition of office landlord Equity Office Properties Trust in 2007 for $39 billion, including debt.FOCUS ON INDUSTRIALThe moves announced on Friday will dramatically reduce GE\u2019s exposure to lending and other financial businesses.GE Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt told investors the company would try to generate 90 percent of its profits from industrial operations by 2018. He had previously forecast that share would grow to 75 percent by 2016 from 55 percent in 2013.\u201cWe just think the market timing is very good vis-a-vis the value of financial service assets,\u201d Immelt said in an interview. \u201cThere have been moments in the past when there weren\u2019t a lot of buyers. Now there are.\u201d Immelt and other GE executives said they planned to spend $3 billion to $5 billion a year on industrial acquisitions.GE said it could return up to $90 billion to investors through a combination of dividends, the $50 billion in share buybacks, and completion of the Synchrony spinoff planned for late this year.\tExecutives gave several reasons for GE's accelerated retreat from financial businesses. One is that since the financial crisis, it has become more difficult for GE to fund its lending operations.GE funded many of its loans and leases by borrowing money from bond markets. During the financial crisis it lost access to that funding, bringing it uncomfortably close to running out of cash. Lenders like GE Capital and CIT Group Inc, which cannot rely on bank deposits to fund their assets, have had to rethink the way they do business since the crisis. Many decided to either shed assets or become banks.GE Capital\u2019s size and the potential risks in its lending portfolio made it subject to government regulation as a systemically important financial institution. GE said it would apply to escape that oversight in 2016 as it reduces the financial business' size. GE said it would take after-tax charges of about $16 billion for the restructuring in the first quarter, of which about $12 billion would be non-cash.Shares of GE were sluggish for the past year despite previous moves to reposition itself around the industrial businesses. Still, Friday\u2019s more dramatic move away from finance caught some analysts by surprise.\"What we did not expect was the speed with which management would move to undertake this transformation,\" Sanford Bernstein analyst Steven Winoker wrote. \"We view today's announcement as an overwhelming positive for the company.\"During the conference call, Barclays analyst Scott Davis told executives that while he had been a critic, \u201cthis is good stuff ... I guess you can keep your jobs a little longer.\"JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co and Centerview Partners provided general financial advice to GE, while Bank of America Corp and Kimberlite Advisors advised on the real estate deal. Eastdil Secured and Wells Fargo Securities were advisers to Blackstone and Wells Fargo.

Firstly, most of the banks have already cut their deposit rates in select maturities over the last 4-5 months.\u00a0&#13;\n&#13;\n\t\"The cuts in deposit rates coupled with reasonable liquidity and lower wholesale funding rates has been leading to reduction in cost of funds and was reflected in better margins in December 2014 quarter and likely in March 2015 quarter as well,\" says Manish Karwa, research analyst at Deutsche Bank. He says that while margin impact of these cuts will be limited, any further rate cuts over the course of the year will impact NIMs for the banks.\u00a0&#13;\n&#13;\n\tAjay Srinivasan, Director, CRISIL Research, echoes this view. \"Lowering of base rate indicates the cost of funds for banks has declined, since base rate is calculated using deposit rates as the benchmark. Thus, decline in base rate would not impact net interest margins (NIMs).\"\u00a0&#13;\n&#13;\n\tOn the contrary, CRISIL Research expects NIMs to improve slightly in 2015-16, backed by a gradual economic recovery and improving proportion of retail loans, which have higher yields, he says.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tLast week, three large banks- SBI, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank cut their base rates by 15-25 basis points post RBI's monetary policy. Experts believe these cuts were long overdue given that RBI has already cut rates by 50 basis points in 2015 so far. While other banks could also trim their base rates, the impact of these cuts will be limited.\u00a0&#13;\n&#13;\n\tState Bank of India officials estimate about Rs 1,200-1,300 crore hit on interest income due to 15 basis point cut in base rate. Analysts believe SBI could witness a 4-5 basis points NIM impact while for ICICI Bank, the hit could be of about 5-6 basis points. In case of HDFC Bank, the impact will be negligible given that a relatively low (20%) proportion of its loan book is linked to the base rate. In case of ICICI Bank and SBI, this ratio stands at 50% and 80%, respectively. However, NIM movement is not contingent on just rates and is determined by other key factors such as credit costs as well.&#13;\n&#13;\n\t\t\t\tHOW THEY STACK UP&#13;\n\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0&#13;\n\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\tBank&#13;\n\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\tNIM (%)&#13;\n\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\tBase rate (%)&#13;\n\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\tSBI&#13;\n\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\t3.2&#13;\n\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\t9.85*&#13;\n\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\tPNB&#13;\n\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\t3.2&#13;\n\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\t10.25&#13;\n\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\tBoB&#13;\n\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\t2.2&#13;\n\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\t10.25&#13;\n\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\tICICI Bank&#13;\n\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\t3.5&#13;\n\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\t9.85*&#13;\n\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\tHDFC Bank&#13;\n\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\t4.4&#13;\n\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\t9.75*&#13;\n\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\tAxis Bank&#13;\n\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\t3.9&#13;\n\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\t9.95*&#13;\n\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\tNIM: Net interest margin as on 31st December, 2014&#13;\n\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0&#13;\n\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0&#13;\n\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\t*Revised base rates&#13;\n\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0&#13;\n\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0&#13;\n\t\t&#13;\n\tMeanwhile, for the quarter ending March 2015, Vaibhav Agrawal, VP Research \u2013 Banking, Angel Broking, says, \"We believe banks' NIMs should improve in the March 2015 quarter due to 3-4 basis points savings in cost of funds. Notably, March quarter would have the full impact of deposit rate cuts and hence may aid NIMs. However, higher credit costs on account of increased non-performing assets could offset these gains to some extent\", he says. \u00a0&#13;\n&#13;\n\tIDBI Bank executives, too, indicate that when clubbed with credit costs - amounts set aside for stressed loans - NIM impact will be more pronounced. Thus, public sector banks which have much higher credit costs as compared to their peers in the private sector will witness higher margin contraction. The actual impact though will vary from one bank to another.&#13;\n&#13;\n\t\"We believe bank-specific NIMs would vary quite meaningfully. Historical margin profiles show that the movement of bank-specific margins in an easing\/tightening cycle are dependent on other factors as well, such as share of fixed rate loans, share of wholesale deposits and changing asset-liability profile\", analysts at Ambit Capital said in a recent report. They believe IndusInd Bank is best placed to protect its margins due to its high fixed rate portfolio, higher share of floating rate liabilities and improving liabilities.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tWhile most analysts believe the margin impact for banks will be limited, some have a contrarion view. Adarsh Parasrampuria of Nomura says, \"Given that banks have cut deposit rates by 25-50 basis points in the last 6-9 months, we would expect them to accelerate base rate cuts now. This will have a negative impact on bank margins, especially for PSUs, in the interim. We believe bank margins, especially for corporate\/PSU banks, will be negatively impacted, due to faster transmission in a falling rate environment. The impact on retail private banks will be lower, given 40-50% of the loan book is fixed in nature.\"","pubdate":"Mon, 13 Apr 2015 08:52:00 +0530","newspaper":"Business Standard"},{"title":"Nifty seen heading towards 8,800; HDFC, SBI in focus","content":"&#13;\n         &#13;\n    &#13;\nMarkets are likely to open higher amid encouraging industrial output in February while select financials will be in focus after they announced cut in home loan rates over the weekend.

The move follows the Union Budget proposal to allow domestic fund managers to also manage offshore funds without adverse tax implications.According to sources, brokerages Edelweiss, Karvy, Centrum and IndiaNivesh are looking to start offshore funds, domiciled abroad but managed by their PMS fund mangers. Some have already approached the market regulator, Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), for a go-ahead.Earlier, domestic fund managers managing offshore money were construed as \"permanent establishment\" and thereby exposed them to additional tax liability. As a result, many operated from abroad, though they managed India investments from there.\"We have filed with Sebi. We are confident that whatever the issues on the tax front will be resolved. The demand from foreign investors to invest into Indian equities is tremendous. We are getting queries from places as far as Europe at this point,\" said Sandeep Jain, director, IndiaNivesh.Sector officials said there was a sharp increase in demand from investors in offshore jurisdictions, including Hong Kong and Singapore, to invest in Indian offerings. \"At this point, very established players are looking to launch offshore funds,\" said Swapnil Pawar, chief investment officer, Karvy Capital.Offshore funds and managers of these funds are required to fulfill certain requirements, specified in the current Finance Bill. These funds have to maintain a monthly average corpus of Rs 100 crore. The participation of Indians in such funds should not exceed five per cent of the corpus. There should be a minimum of 25 investors in each fund.\"The challenge for such funds would be the eligibility requirement, for funds and their managers. There is also some ambiguity on tax-related issues,\" said Pranay Bhatia, partner-direct tax, BDO India.Domestically, PMS providers need to have a minimum net worth of Rs 2 crore. They mainly cater to wealthy clients and must have a minimum size of Rs 25 lakh.Experts said starting of offshore funds would be an easy extension of the existing business for PMS providers. More entities are awaiting further clarity on the tax front before taking a decision. Clarifications from the Central Bureau of Direct Taxes are expected soon, they say.The interest generated by the Indian market among investors abroad in the past year has created interest among PMS providers on tapping this relatively unexposed business opportunity.\"The present taxation structure has an inbuilt incentive for fund managers to operate from offshore locations. To encourage such offshore fund managers to relocate to India, I propose to modify the permanent establishment (PE) norms to the effect that mere presence of a fund manager in India would not constitute PE of the offshore funds, resulting in adverse tax consequences,\" Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said in his Budget speech on February 28.Sectoral officials also said in cases where PMS providers already have offshore funds, many fund managers have started returning to India.

Experts believe there are many positive steps in the offing after the already announced measures.The Street believes credit default swaps (CDS) could be relaunched, steps to enhance liquidity in corporate bonds might be announced and a full-fledged and screen-based trading system for corporate bonds could be put in place.In the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) bi-monthly monetary policy review last week, it had spoken of\u00a0 formulating a scheme for market making by primary dealers in semi-liquid and illiquid government securities. \"A similar step could perhaps be taken by asking merchant bankers in corporate bonds to provide liquidity. Today, once the bonds get sold, these merchant bankers no longer provide liquidity to the market,\" said R Sivakumar, head of fixed income and products, Axis Mutual Fund.RBI also announced steps to boost retail participation in government securities. These include a web-based solution for all mid-segment and retail investors who have gilt accounts to participate in the G-Sec market, and providing them direct access to both primary and secondary market platforms without any intermediary. For this, alternate channels of distribution in G-sec would be created, RBI said.\u201cRetail participation in G-secs will take a long time, as fixed deposit rates are more attractive. There is scope for reforms in the corporate bond market. For instance, it is critical to have a full-fledged screen-based trading system for bonds,\" said S Prabhu, head of fixed income at IDBI Federal Life Insurance.Currently, secondary market activity in corporate bonds is negligible when compared with G-sec volumes. Besides, though CDS made its debut in 2011, the instruments failed to take off. CDS are instruments where the buyer receives credit protection, while the seller of the swap guarantees the creditworthiness of the security.\u201cThe CDS market is needed because those who invest in corporate bonds are exposed to interest rate and credit risks. We might also see reissue of bonds by companies, so that there is more liquidity in the market,\u201d said K P Jeewan, head of fixed income, Karvy Stock Broking.According to Nirakar Pradhan, chief investment officer of Future Generali India Life Insurance, the corporate bond market also needs a more transparent settlement mechanism.","pubdate":"Mon, 13 Apr 2015 00:25:00 +0530","newspaper":"Business Standard"},{"title":"Rollover of MFs beyond 36 months not capital gains: CBDT","content":"&#13;\n         &#13;\n    &#13;\nIn a major relief to investors, the rollover of mutual fund fixed maturity plans (FMPs) beyond 36 months will not attract capital gains.

The capital gains will, however, arise at the time of redemption of the units or opting out of the scheme, as the case may be,\u201d CBDT said.FMPs are closed-ended funds having a fixed maturity date wherein the duration of investment is decided upfront.Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had last increased the concessional capital gains tax rate from 10 to 20 per cent on debt-oriented mutual funds and also the holding period from 12 months to 36 months. Short-term capital gains are taxed at income tax rate of individuals.As a result, gains arising out of any investment in the units of FMPs made before July 7, 2014 and sold\/redeemed after the date would be taxed as short-term capital gains if the unit was held for a period of 36 months or less.To enable the FMPs to qualify as long-term capital asset, some Asset Management Companies (AMCs) administering mutual funds have offered extension of the duration of the FMPs to a date beyond 36 months from the date of original investment by providing an option to investors to rollover of FMPs.Representations were received in the CBDT seeking clarification regarding applicability of tax on capital gains at the time of roll over of FMPs.Market regulator SEBI has also said the scheme remains the same in case of roll-over and does not constitute a different scheme.","pubdate":"Mon, 13 Apr 2015 00:24:00 +0530","newspaper":"Business Standard"},{"title":"Edible oils outlook: Is the worst over for the sector?","content":"&#13;\n         &#13;\n    &#13;\nDuring the oilseed year 2014-15, total soymeal exports between October 2014 and January 2015 were a dismal 438,135 tonnes, compared with 1.5 million tonnes during the corresponding period in 2013-14.

The 70 per cent fall in soymeal exports is sharp and is raising viability concerns for crushers. Soymeal is a by-product in the process of crushing soybean to produce soy oil. Lower crushing will lead to higher import of soy oil. Import of soy oil have, in fact, grown steadily over the years and touched 1.95 million tonnes in 2014-15.Soymeal exports are usually robust during October-February. They start declining after this period, when importers (our foreign customers) shift to other origins like South America, which begins harvesting a new soybean crop. With production rising and demand falling year-on-year, soybean stocks at the end of 2014-15 are expected to be higher if the demand doesn't see any pick-up.With the Indian soymeal season drawing to an end on a drastically poor note and world supplies set to rise in the coming days, Indian soymeal is set to face severe headwinds.If we take a look at the palm oil scenario, the production cycle in Malaysia is likely to turn to a high-yielding phase from March, recovering from the setbacks of weather anomalies, which will add to the supply side. If the weather remains conducive through the year, we could see production estimates revised higher. Production for 2015 is expected to be 20.5 mt, up from 20.2 mt in 2014. Also, one must watch out for crude oil prices and implementation of the bio-diesel mandate. If crude oil prices continue to remain under pressure, it would eventually make production of bio-diesel unviable. This would be mean further addition to the surplus palm oil available for consumption.After a sharp fall in crude oil prices, we have seen a drop in bio-diesel production. But if crude oil bottoms out, which looks likely, and gradually moves up, it will lead to an uptick in demand from bio-diesel sector.We will see arrivals of soybean from the world's two largest producing countries in full swing. This would mean higher crushing and, thereby, higher soy oil production.In India, we would also witness higher arrivals of rabi oilseeds from mid-March, likely to add to domestic vegetable oil supplies.According to the latest data, India's vegetable oil stockpiles stand above two mt, a level not seen at this point of time over the past few years. Therefore, higher supply of oils will dominate the market in 2015. However, prices of edible oils, which have remained under pressure, seem to have discounted the glut.The focus will be on sowing in the US and India. Any delay or drop in sowing can support prices. Pick up in Chinese demand and gradual increase in crude oil prices can also trigger an uptick in edible oil prices.&#13;\n\tThe author is head of commodities research, Nirmal Bang","pubdate":"Mon, 13 Apr 2015 00:18:00 +0530","newspaper":"Business Standard"},{"title":"Retail investors miss out on REC offer for sale","content":"&#13;\n         &#13;\n    Most retail investors failed to get any allotment in the Rural Electrification Corp (REC) offer for sale (OFS) conducted last week.

Married couples and civil partners can pass the allowance on to each other.If the Conservatives win the general election, then from April 2017 parents would each be offered a further \u00a3175,000 \"family home allowance\" to enable them to pass property on to children tax-free after their death.This could be added to the existing \u00a3325,000 inheritance tax threshold, bringing the total transferable tax-free allowance from both parents in a married couple or civil partnership to \u00a31m.The full amount would be transferable even if one spouse had died before the policy came into effect, the Conservatives say, and so would benefit existing widows and widowers.For properties worth more than \u00a32m, the new allowance would be gradually reduced so that those with homes worth more than \u00a32.35m would not benefit at all.Analysis, by Carole Walker, Conservative campaign correspondentDavid Cameron will be hoping his pledge to take the family home out of inheritance tax will galvanise his campaign in a week which will be critical for his prospects of staying in power.When George Osborne promised to raise the inheritance tax threshold to \u00a31m back in 2007, he delivered a huge boost to Tory morale and put Gordon Brown off holding a snap election. Subsequent promises to take more people out of the tax have not been delivered.  The threshold has been frozen since 2009 and rising property prices have dragged tens of thousands more families into the inheritance tax net. His opponents are already questioning whether voters will believe this latest promise. The announcement is likely to appeal to middle-class voters, particularly in London and the South East. But it also opens the Conservatives to the charge they are helping the wealthy.  David Cameron's team deny this - pointing out that it will be paid for by reducing pension tax relief for high earners and that many ordinary families now have to pay the tax.It is, however, a marked contrast to the promises from Labour and the Liberal Democrats to impose a \"mansion tax\" on expensive properties. Mr Osborne told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: \"Conservatives support the basic human instinct to provide for your children. And we believe that your home that you've worked for and you've saved for should belong to you and your family, not the tax man.\"So we will take family homes out of inheritance tax, we will effectively increase the inheritance tax threshold to \u00a31m, so that only millionaires pay inheritance tax.\"It was a message repeated in a speech by Mr Cameron, who said: \"You should be able to pass it (your home) onto your children. And with the Conservatives, the tax man will not get his hands on it.\"But shadow treasury secretary Chris Leslie, for Labour, said the policy was the latest \"panicky promise\" from the Conservatives. He said: \"The Tories made a promise on inheritance tax before the last election and they broke it. \"At a time when our NHS is in crisis and most working people are paying more under the Tories, it cannot be a priority to spend \u00a31bn on a policy which the Treasury says would not apply to 90% of estates.\"Danny Alexander said: \"It is extraordinary that the Tories will go into great detail on a policy that will cut tax for a small number of estates, but steadfastly refuse to give any detail at all on the massive cuts to public services that they desire.\"However, when asked whether the Lib Dems would block the proposals if they ended up back in coalition, he declined to say he would, instead saying: \"I'm saying I strongly disagree with it.

These fees are paid by retailers to card issuers when a debit or credit card is used as payment. The European Commission claims that the fees are costing retailers across the eurozone \u20ac9bn (\u00a36.5bn) a year.It has described them as a \"direct attack on the single market\" and that they may be as high as 1.5% on every transaction made by consumers. They have traditionally been higher in countries like Poland and Lithuania, where credit cards are less commonly used.The new rules, which are due to pass into law later this month, would cap interchange fees at 0.2% for debit and 0.3% for credit transactions.The ruling follows a decade-long legal battle between Brussels and the card provider Mastercard. Lost revenueCritics claim that as well as being opaque, interchange fees can act as a bar to the introduction of new payment technology, such as fingerprint based payment systems or contactless mobile phone payments, and reform is needed at a time when alternative payment platforms like Paypal and Apple Pay are eating into market share. However, the new caps have raised concerns that credit card firms may seek to recoup lost revenue elsewhere. Capital One has written to its customers informing them that it is either cutting cashback points on its cards or axing them completely from 1 June.In a statement it said that \"following the European Parliament's resolution... the implications of significantly lower interchange revenue has meant... several (products) are no longer sustainable under current market conditions\".  It added that the changes will affect both existing and new customers. Greg Welch has had his Capital One \"Aspire World\" credit card, paying 1% cashback, for five years.

After being a loyal Capital One customer for years, I shall now try to source a better deal (elsewhere).\" The industry body, the UK Cards Association, had lobbied against the caps on fees, claiming \"they would upset the balance of cost-sharing between retailers and cardholders\".The association, whose members issue 55 million credit cards a year, has also warned that fee caps will mean less investment in fraud protection as well as fewer competitive offers for customers, indicating that other credit card rewards such as air miles or points on supermarket loyalty schemes may also be affected.  Capital One says has declined to say which of its cards, or how many customers overall, would be affected by the changes.

Thousands of Native Americans died on the journey west - known as the Trail of Tears - from exposure, starvation and disease.His controversial legacy is one of the reasons why Women On 20s chose to target this particular bill for change.Meanwhile in Canada, more than 54,000 people have signed a petition to put a woman on a banknote there after the sole female to appear on the country's currency, Therese Casgrain, was replaced in 2011 by an icebreaker ship.\"When we open our wallets and see the faces of four male prime ministers and Queen Elizabeth, the subtle message is that Canadian women aren't worthy of being celebrated,\" says author and historian Merna Forster who started the Canadian campaign.   \"Sexist banknotes are unacceptable in a country that boasts of being a world leader in promoting gender equality\u2026 If women are equal to men in Canada, they should be equally represented on our banknotes.\"\nSweden. \"We thought it was very important to feature an equal number of men and womenSusanne Eberstein, Sweden's Riksbank\nA similar petition was launched in the UK in 2013 after it was announced that Winston Churchill would replace Elizabeth Fry - a social reformer and philanthropist - on the \u00a35 note. More than 36,000 people signed it and convinced the Bank of England to put the author Jane Austen on the \u00a310 note from 2017.In both the UK and Canada, the Queen's portrait is on many banknotes. But, critics say this doesn't count because she appears as a monarch rather than for her achievements. Plus, she will eventually be replaced by a male heir.Although the UK petition was a success, campaigners in all three countries - the US, Canada and the UK - have called for only one woman on a note. But is that enough? Should half of all portraits on currencies be of women, better reflecting the makeup of the population?That's what's happened in Sweden. \"We thought it was very important to feature an equal number of men and women,\" says Susanne Eberstein, the chairman of the General Council at the country's Riksbank. \"It was well in line with our aims. It was very natural.\"Women appear on three of the banknotes there, although one of those depicted is Mother Sweden. A new line of Swedish notes, to be introduced in 2015 and 2016, will feature three men and three women - actress Greta Garbo, Pippi Longstocking author Astrid Lindgren, and opera singer Birgit Nilsson.Australia, too, has an equal number of men and women on its banknotes - each one has a male on one side and a woman on the other, apart from one with the Queen on it which has parliamentary buildings on the reverse.So why isn't Women On 20s petitioning for more than one woman to appear on American dollar bills?The organisation does believe there should be more women on notes but wanted to be realistic about its initial goal. \"We hope this is just the beginning,\" says Stone.But if bills should equally represent men and women, shouldn't they also reflect a nation's racial diversity? Again, this isn't usually the case, although there are exceptions. Australia, for example, has five bills in circulation, one of which features David Unaipon, an Aboriginal man. Unaipon was a pioneer for Aboriginal rights as well as a distinguished inventor and writer.Every US note features a white man, albeit one of the country's presidents or Founding Fathers, even though the US population comprises many races - notably, 13% are black and 17% Hispanic. The US Census Bureau lists seven different races, although Americans no doubt identify with many more ethnic backgrounds.  When the Women On 20s selection committee compiled their list of female candidates, they were conscious of diversity, but they did not set out to fill any particular quota, Stone says. Instead, they focused on the candidates' overall impact and trusted that a diverse group would result from the selection process. It did. The 15 female candidates include African, Asian and Native Americans as well as Caucasians.\n                        Another finalist in the vote - Wilma Mankiller, first female principal chief of the Cherokee Nation\n                    \n                \"I feel that the money that we have now is very last century,\" says Stone, adding that the US has changed enormously.\"We're more diverse. We're more inclusive. And the money should reflect that.\" However, \"It would be unrealistic to imagine that we could have a female representative of every ethnic group on the bills,\" she says. \"That's for another campaign.\"Perhaps a country can't fully represent the diversity of its population on a handful of notes. Euro bills - tasked with representing a huge span of people, cultures and history - depict stylised images of windows, doorways and bridges. Not even actual monuments, let alone portraits of real people.So could this be the solution - no portraits at all?Norway currently has women on two of its five banknotes. \"In a society where gender equality is an important value, having both male and female portraits on the banknotes is a matter of course,\" says Hilde Singsaas, from Norges Bank.However, Norway will soon be getting rid of both men and women when it introduces a new series of notes which will have a sea theme. The specific designs are not yet finalised but proposed motifs (below) feature ships, water and fish. This wasn't because of difficulty reflecting the diversity of Norway's population through portraits though, Singsaas says.\"All the previous banknote series featured portraits as the primary motif, without any clear connection between them,\" she explains. \"This time, the aim was to find a recurrent theme binding the banknotes together into a coherent whole.\"Similarly, Denmark recently introduced a new series of notes featuring bridges and prehistoric objects rather than people. Its previous series of five bills had women on two, men on two and one with a woman and a man. On its website, the Danish National Bank explains that the bridges symbolise links between various parts of Denmark and between the past and present.Putting bridges instead of people on the notes did not have anything to do with difficulty depicting a diverse population, says the bank's spokesman Lars Luth Mikkelsen.Another reason it might be easier to choose landscapes or buildings over people is that prominent figures are often controversial in one way or another, like Jackson in the US.Every person that you put on a banknote will garner some negative and some positive feedback, says Sweden's Eberstein. She and the Riksbank received criticism about the decision to put opera singer Birgit Nilsson on one of Sweden's new notes. Nilsson is pictured singing an opera by Richard Wagner, whose works are sometimes associated with Nazi Germany.Eberstein pointed out that Nilsson most often performed Wagner, who is still very popular today.\"She was a world famous singer,\" Eberstein says, \"and a good representative of Sweden at that time.\"And Women On 20s' Stone admits, \"You can never please everyone.\"Subscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox.\n    ","pubdate":"Mon, 13 Apr 2015 04:58:42 +0530","newspaper":"BBC"},{"title":"Amazon sues four paid review sites","content":"\n                        Amazon alleges that paid reviews undermine the trust people have in its site\n                    \n                Amazon has sued four firms that pay people to produce reviews that then appear on the online retailer's site.The company alleges that the paid opinions \"undermine\" its review system which customers believe come from unbiased sources.Amazon is seeking damages from the four sites and wants them to stop producing the reviews.The four companies named in the legal complaint have not yet responded to Amazon's allegations.\"While small in number, these reviews threaten to undermine the trust that customers, and the vast majority of sellers and manufacturers, place in Amazon, thereby tarnishing Amazon's brand,\" said the retailer in documents filed to the court in Washington.As well as subverting the review process, Amazon accused the sites of trademark infringement, and violations of local consumer protection statutes and cybersquatting laws that govern who can own a domain name. It alleged that the paid reviews were being placed on its site at a slow rate designed to outwit the detection system it ran to spot such content.  In its legal papers, Amazon said it verified its allegations by surreptitiously paying one of the services to write reports about products. This resulted in them getting \"glowing\" reviews, it said.The legal papers name four review producers that operate via sites called buyazonreviews.com, buyamazonreviews.com, bayreviews.net and buyreviewsnow.com. Since the legal action was filed two of the sites named have gone offline. Those still operating have yet to respond to the BBC's request for comments. Mark Collins, who runs the Buy Amazon Reviews site, defended his business in an interview with The Seattle Times. He said the site did not provide \"fake\" reviews but provided \"unbiased and honest\" opinions about products.The sites pay between $19-$22 (\u00a313-\u00a315) for each review which typically result in products getting a four or five star rating.

The Institute of Directors says it has warned already that Mr Ashley holds too much sway and the IoD's senior advisor on corporate governance, Oliver Parry says that there is no \"effective check on [Mr Ashley's] power\". Now his firm's handling of the collapse of one of its businesses, fashion chain USC, is also under scrutiny, being described at the Scottish Affairs Committee as \"well dodgy\".When approached by the BBC, a spokesman for Sports Direct declined to comment.USC, which sells clothing aimed at the younger market, ran into trouble last year after a row with a supplier. The company was losing \u00a320m a year and collapsed into administration in January, with the loss of 83 jobs at the USC distribution depot in South Ayrshire, provoking some indignation in Scotland. When the Scottish affairs committee met last month it was determined to find out more. Members were told, though, that Mr Ashley simply wasn't available to answer parliamentarians' questions at any point during the month of March.  Mr Ashley's legal representatives then took exception to the committee's habit of publishing correspondence, citing \"concerns over confidentiality\" and going as far as to invoke the European Convention on Human Rights.Keith Hellawell, the company's chairman, was sent in Mr Ashley's place. But he told the committee he and the board hadn't known anything about the collapse of USC until the day before it folded. But, he said, chief executive Dave Forsey had begun \"consulting\" with administrators Duff and Phelps as early as 14 November. Dr Hellawell insisted the firm \"didn't want\" USC to fold.'Well dodgy'Perhaps even more controversially USC hasn't shut up shop. Almost immediately after it went into administration the fashion retailer was bought by another part of Mr Ashley's business empire, through a so-called pre-pack administration, and is trading again. But with less debt, according to MPs. Conservative MP Simon Reevell told the Scottish affairs committee: \"Sports Direct had a company that was losing money, they now have the same company where the debt liability that had been incurred has gone.\"\"At one level, to use a technical phrase, this all looks well dodgy,\" he added.\n                        Mr Ashley built up his retailing empire after leaving school\n                    \n                Committee chairman Ian Davidson lamented how the process left the taxpayer \"done over\" in having to meet redundancy costs and unpaid taxes.  Dr Hellawell countered that by saying the company had paid more than \u00a31.3bn in tax to date.Board authorityThis latest controversy builds on earlier concerns.The IoD previously criticised a \u00a3200m payment to employees, including Mr Ashley. The company didn't disclose his share of the award. But \"we expect as a majority shareholder he got the majority of that,\" said Mr Parry.Paying a dividend, which would have been shared among all shareholders, may have been more appropriate, said Mr Parry. There are even more questions swirling around the collapse of USC.\"Could they have done something about it? And could they not have told shareholders and staff?\"If there had been a failure to inform the board sooner, this would suggest a lack of respect for the board's authority, he said.Workers were given even less notice, 15 minutes, before they heard they'd lost their jobs, the committee was told.Fatter marginsTo be sure, Mr Ashley has built a very clever business model. As well as owning stores, Sports Direct owns rights to popular brands such as Slazenger, Dunlop and Lonsdale. Good margins on these products mean he can afford to sell big brand products from the likes of Nike and Adidas at a greater discount than competitors, luring in shoppers.\n                        The company's success has made Mr Ashley a billionaire - he now owns Newcastle United Football Club\n                    \n                So when a customer pops in for a pair of Nike trainers, they can also be tempted to buy a Slazenger T-shirt or a pair of Lonsdale shorts with a fatter margin for Mr Ashley.Short leases on its stores mean it can be more flexible with demand, quickly shutting up shop and moving elsewhere if sales drop.It's a formula that has brought riches to shareholders in the long run. Those who bought shares in 2007 for \u00a33 apiece when Mr Ashley floated his firm would have more than doubled their money today. Luckier punters could have snapped up shares for as little as 32p in the crisis in 2008 and sold them last year for more than \u00a38. The firm has also been criticised for its zealous use of zero hours contracts, which don't guarantee regular work. Mr Hellawell told MPs that 4,300 of the firm's 19,000 staff were permanent. The rest of its workers are employed on zero-hours contracts.In terms of what must be done at Sports Direct, the IoD's Mr Parry said: \"It's hard to be prescriptive, but power lies with shareholders\" who must voice concerns at the firm's annual meeting on 10 September.Investors, employees and customers alike can watch Mr. Ashley to see whether this time he'd like to defend himself against these new allegations \n    ","pubdate":"Mon, 13 Apr 2015 04:40:29 +0530","newspaper":"BBC"},{"title":"From Lego bricks to luxury flats","content":"For an architect well known for his attention to detail, smart phones are a godsend for Soo Chan.The Singapore-based 53-year-old uses an app on his mobile phone to keep a close eye on his various projects around the world, such as a new luxury apartment building in New York.\"When I'm in Singapore there's a 12-hour time difference [with New York], so before I go to bed at night, I check on it through this app,\" says Mr Chan.The app connects to video cameras, which give him a real time view of construction work.He adds:  \"I can even zoom in and look closely at the welding.\"\nIn Asia there are three professions - lawyer, doctor and accountantSoo Chan\nThe founder and design director of Singapore-based SCDA Architects, Mr Chan has over the past 20 years built up a business that today employs more than 100 architects and designers.Its past projects around the world range from luxury hotel resorts in Bali and the Caribbean, the National Design Centre in Singapore, a shopping centre in Beijing, a government building in New Delhi, to private houses from France to Malaysia.It is quite an achievement for an architect who built the company without the need for outside investors, after starting out with just five members of staff.'Neo-tropical architecture'Born in Penang, Malaysia, before being raised in Singapore, Mr Chan says his first work as an architect was building things with Lego bricks as a small child.He also remembers from his young childhood that he was fascinated by watching his family's new home being constructed.\n                        His latest project is a luxury apartment building in New York with private swimming pools\n                    \n                Yet despite this early interest in architecture, his family had other hopes for him. \"In Asia there are three professions - lawyer, doctor and accountant,\" says Mr Chan.But determined to study architecture after leaving school, he travelled to the US where he did a degree in the subject at the prestigious Yale University in Connecticut.\n                        SCDA's buildings often feature courtyards\n                    \n                Mr Chan subsequently spent two years in New York, working for architectural firm Kohn Pederson Fox.The lure of home then saw him return to Singapore, where in 1995 he started SCDA Architects.Mixing both Asian and Western design, Mr Chan has developed his own style, which he calls \"neo-tropical architecture\", and which often aims to blur the lines between the inside and outside of a building, often utilising - in very simple terms - lots of courtyards.Mr Chan says that the practice has grown slowly but steadily over the years.While most staff are based at the headquarters in Singapore, some are located in Shanghai and New York.And despite his reputation for attention to detail, and regular visits to the other two offices, Mr Chan says he knows the importance of delegating.\"I focus on the bigger picture, and then come in and look selectively at the small, important details. I then find that the middle bit takes care of itself,\" he says.\n                        SCDA now employs more than 100 architects and designers\n                    \n                He adds that he relies on key employees to handle the day-to-day functioning of the company, confident that everyone at the firm speaks \"the same design language\".\"We share the same thinking about how you design and use space.\"'Big moment'Married, and with no less than six sons, Mr Chan's latest big development at work is the Soori High Line apartment building, which is currently being built in Manhattan, New York.He says it is a \"big moment\" for him, as it will be the first building he has built in the city where he began his working life as an architect.\n                        When not working, Mr Chan has a big family to look after\n                    \n                The luxury scheme has raised eyebrows in the Big Apple because 16 of the building's 31 apartments will have their own private, indoor swimming pools, something of a rarity in the city.\"The pools are definitely the highlight,\" says Mr Chan, who has already built apartment blocks in East Asia with private pools.\"It certainly evokes a reaction, you either like it, or you think it's a bit crazy. People think - it's a pool. Do I swim every day? How do I maintain it?\"But true luxury means never having to worry about all these practicalities.\"The risk is not in the making of it, but in culturally getting everyone - even my own salespeople and consultants - on board.\"The building is due to be finished in 2016, and Mr Chan is confident it will be a sell-out.

Indeed, if the trend continues, we could well buy more than 30,000 electric vehicles this year alone.But the good news is also the bad: The government's \u00a35,000 subsidy on each new car will run out when a total of 50,000 have been sold - and that target could now be reached before the end of the year. Going Electric: Monthly Car sales in UK\nMarch 2015\nChange on March 2014\nPlug-in pure electric\n1,905\n+ 131.5%\nPlug-in hybrid\n4,209\n+ 984.8%\nAll plug-in cars eligible for grant\n6,104\n+ 404%\nSource: SMMT 8 April 2015\n\n\nIncentivesSo what has changed since 2011?To start with, there are many more plug-in models to chose from. Then there were just six; now there are 27 models which qualify for the government grant.The network of charging points has also expanded. There are now 3,000 places in the UK where you can plug in, and by doing so take advantage of motoring costs as low as 2p a mile.\"It's a classic rolling boulder,\" says Jim Holder, the editor of What Car? magazine.\"More manufacturers have come in, the infrastructure has grown, and there are a lot of incentives behind buying a car.\"Those incentives have been key: Road tax exemption, free entry to London's congestion zone, and the fact that the government currently pays  as much as \u00a35,000 towards the cost of a car - the plug-in grant. Company car tax rates are also much lower (see below).But beware. By my calculations, based on government and the SMMT figures, 31,000 plug-in grants have now been paid - leaving another 19,000 before the scheme ends.Given that we bought 8,500 eligible cars in the first three months of 2015, the grants may well run out by the Autumn.  If you're thinking of going electric, it may pay you to put your foot down.The scheme is due to be reviewed in May, but as yet no one knows whether the subsidy will be extended.\n                        Larry Wood believes customers will still buy electric cars, even without the subsidy\n                    \n                Car taxAt his show-room in north London, car dealer Larry Wood, of Hummingbird Motors, is unperturbed. The main reason is that Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV - a plug-in hybrid SUV - has proved so popular.It is now Britain's best-selling electric car, with more than 10,000 sales in the last year. He believes customers won't stop buying them, even if the plug-in grant is no longer available.\"If that does run out in the future, I still think people will buy these cars, but it just makes them \u00a35,000 cheaper,\" he says.In any case, some of his best customers are businesses, for whom the capital cost is not the only consideration. The main attraction for them is a lower rate of car tax. While the most polluting cars pay 35% in company car tax, electric cars - even though they used to be exempt - pay 5%.As a result, any business with a fleet of vehicles could still save thousands of pounds a year by going electric.TechnologyMost of the problems initially associated with electric vehicles are gradually being resolved, or so the industry would have you believe.\"Range anxiety\" - the fear of running out of charge - does not apply if you buy a hybrid car, which switches to its conventional engine as soon as the battery runs out of power.Nevertheless, those who drive pure electric cars still worry about getting stranded. \"Range anxiety will never go away,\" says Jim Holder.But ranges are being extended. Whereas a maximum range of 100 miles used to be typical, the latest cars offer well over that. General Motors hopes that its Bolt model, currently on the drawing board, will have a 200 mile range.The super-expensive Tesla S - already on sale in the UK - will go for 310 miles without a charge, according to the manufacturer.Another problem has been the cost of batteries, the main reason that electric cars are so pricey in the first place.But advances in technology could make them cost-competitive with petrol engines in less than a decade, according to two Swedish scientists.\n                        Tesla's fast-charge station in Maidstone, Kent\n                    \n                'Ferrari'Time spent charging has been another bugbear of electric motorists - if you can find a charge point of course.The government boasts there are now 7,000 in the UK, in 3,000 locations. 500 of those are \"fast chargers\", which can offer a 50% charge in as little as 20 minutes.But in reality, most charging stops are going to be for at least half an hour.And for motorists, understanding the rival charge point networks - and the different costs for using them - still requires some tenacity.Public subsidies for infrastructure have also changed, with the government ending its specific grant of up to \u00a37,500 per charge point.However, there is still some support available for owners under the Electric Vehicle Homecharge Scheme, which pays householders up to \u00a3700 to have a charge point installed at home.What is undeniable is that the appeal of the cars themselves has certainly improved.Where once electric cars looked like garden shed conversions, the designers of BMW and Porsche have now worked magic.Performance too has improved significantly. \"You now get instant torque away from the traffic lights,\" says Jim Holder. \"Frankly, not even a Ferrari will beat you off the line.\"\n    ","pubdate":"Sat, 11 Apr 2015 02:32:14 +0530","newspaper":"BBC"},{"title":"Who would buy in Dubai?","content":"\n                        Many investors have been tempted by the combination of swanky apartments and luxury lifestyle\n                    \n                Homebuyers in Dubai can choose from an apartment block with interiors encrusted in shiny crystals or multimillion-dollar villas on a man-made island.

The BBC's Mark Lobel investigates.There are countless reasons why people still buy in Dubai.It is the perfect tax haven for rich foreigners.Long-term resident and British developer Andrew Lemon says: \"Sun, fun, no tax still applies - and it's a big draw.\" He has noticed some people prefer it to Monaco to flee tax laws in France.Dubai is also a safe haven for regional investors in a stormy Middle East.Lebanese-born businesswoman Nejoud Nasr left Beirut for Jordan in 1975 when the civil war began. She feels Dubai is now the safest place in the region for a family, with the rest of the Middle East \"marked by a lot of political instability\".Blend of East and WestFor wealthy Asians, it is a close-by, comfortable, retirement village.For Indian former private banker Ranjita Balasubramaniam, Dubai ticks a lot of boxes.She likes its blend of East and West, wants to settle in the Emirates and employ domestic staff to help her at home.\"We have always had help around us. Dubai allows you the ability to have that,\" she said.A surge in house prices and sales since 2013 suggests confidence is returning to Dubai's real estate sector after its disastrous past.But what went wrong and has anything actually changed?Musical chairsWhen foreigners were permitted to buy in 2002, it helped turn the obscure fishing village into a global hub.Estate agents who watched the property boom over the next six years said it was like the Wild West because the regulations were so lax.Speculators made a fast buck by selling off-plan properties for a large profit within weeks of their initial investment - with no intention of ever living there.Linda Mahoney, one of Dubai's first Western estate agents, described it as a game of musical chairs.\"It went on and on and on and there was always another place to sit\u2026 In June 2008 the music stopped and the chair wasn't there.\"\n                        Investment apartments are large and can be sumptuously appointed\n                    \n                Once the global credit crisis of 2007 spread to Dubai a year later, lending dried up, many foreign investors left and confidence in the emirate's overinflated real estate market was shattered.It was a bloody period as property prices fell from between a third to under half of their previous value in months. The stock market fell 70% and thousands of mostly Asian labourers were sent back home.Huge housing projects were stalled or scrapped.Before the crash, investors piled into one large, well-located apartment block named after Hanover Square in the West End of London.The Dubai development is 15 minutes from a golf course and the sea and half an hour from the busiest international airport in the world.In 2007 investors put down tens of thousands of dollars but have so far received nothing.Its developer ACW Holdings said it is \"rapidly nearing completion\". When I visited the site it looked about 80% ready. It should have been completed six years ago.Others have been less lucky and lost everything on cancelled projects.Surreally craftedAnother effect of the financial crisis was the alarming exposure of Dubai's huge, outstanding debt at the time.To understand it, I took a boat trip around the iconic Palm Jumeirah to see the eye-watering multimillion dollar villas on the man-made island.They represent a life of poolside and yacht-filled luxury surreally crafted in the middle of the desert.Yet in 2008 the ambitious island project, along with two others also built by the government-owned developer Nakheel, nearly brought Dubai to the brink of defaulting on its debt because so much had been borrowed to make it happen.Only a $20bn lifeline from Dubai's oil-rich neighbour, Abu Dhabi, saved it from going bust.Half the money was used to bail out Nakheel, which brought in a new man to steer it to calmer waters.The Nakheel chairman Ali Rashid Lootah told me the company had a remaining $1.2bn of debt that he expects to clear by August next year.However, other state-related entities are holding $140bn worth of debt, according to the International Monetary Fund, which it believes is a worrying amount if another downturn occurs.But real-estate regulations have improved.UnpredictableThe government has discouraged speculators by doubling a transaction tax and there are rules to help investors seek compensation if a project is cancelled.The combination of the new rules and weaker economic conditions globally, which affect investment in Dubai as foreigners make up around 90% of its population, means the market is cooling. Property prices have dropped about 5% so far this year.Yet many in the industry do not rule out another bubble forming - as Dubai remains unpredictable.Sunil Jaiswal organised the first international property show dedicated to Dubai. He told me that the question he gets asked most in any show is whether the market will crash.\"Right now the market is quite stable in Dubai. We haven't seen excessive growth... Will the market crash? Of course it will. Maybe it's three months away. I don't know,\" Mr Jaiswal said.Ms Mahoney also anticipates there may be an overheating of the market as Dubai's hosting of the Expo 2020 international trade fair nears.\n                        Emaar, a leading property developer in the UAE, also built the Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building\n                    \n                \"By 2016-17 I think that the government will probably have to be careful and watch out for another bubble. That's my feeling,\" she said.At the top of one of Dubai's grandest designs, the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building on Earth, I met the man whose company Emaar built it and which has sold tens of thousands of properties in Dubai.StormMohamed Alabbar is one of the emirate's richest and most politically well-connected developers.He said the current dip in the market - which he prefers to call \"a nice adjustment\" - may last for up to two years and has made the city \"much more affordable\".It ties in nicely with his belief that Dubai could become the New York or London of the Middle East by rivalling the amenities and business facilities of the global cities while offering a better location and cost.\"The region around us, with two billion people, they are all looking for an interesting hub where you can live, where you can invest, where it is safe, where it is prosperous, clean and progressive,\" he said.He did concede that more needs to be done by the government to address the plight of badly paid and poorly housed construction workers, who typically earn between $130 and $380 a month with free board and lodging in often cramped conditions.Last month, a rare protest was held by hundreds of South Asian labourers on a development of Mr Alabbar's near the Burj Khalifa, despite a ban on protests in the emirate. The labourers were concerned that their pay was dramatically down after a cut in overtime work. Mr Alabbar's company, Emaar, said the contractors employing the workers had been given clear guidelines to carry out their duties properly and resolve the matter quickly.   There is also uncertainty over how the region will cope with low oil prices. Although Dubai is not directly reliant on oil revenues, many of its lenders and investors are.So there are many unknowns on which Dubai's future rests. However exciting an opportunity it may appear, estate agents recommend that only long-term investors who can weather a financial storm should consider buying in Dubai.Even then, any investment should be handled with care.\n    ","pubdate":"Sun, 12 Apr 2015 16:15:53 +0530","newspaper":"BBC"},{"title":"Kurdistan's budget battle with Baghdad","content":"\n                        A Kurdish Peshmerga fighter standing guard on the frontline, 25 miles (40km) south of Erbil\n                    \n                In Iraqi Kurdistan, the Kurds' battle with Islamic State has been complicated by the halving of global oil prices over the past year and a dispute with the central government in Baghdad that has seen the region's revenues dry up. Many in Kurdistan have not been paid for months.Commander Faridon Jwanroyi holds up his AK-47 rifle and fires off a few rounds, purely for my benefit. \"I wish there was Islamic State here, I could fire at them!\" he jokes. I would have asked for a more dramatic display, but the Peshmerga - the Kurdish fighting force here - are a bit short on weaponry. In fact they're a bit short on ammunition, too. And since December, they've even run out of money to pay their soldiers.\"Some haven't been paid in three months,\" he confides, when we met in late March. \"It's hard. They have to pay for their rent, for the children's clothes. But still, we fight on. We have belief.\" Weaker oil pricesBut with talk now of a combined Iraqi-Kurdish operation to liberate Iraq's second city, Mosul, it is an open question whether belief alone can bring victory. Indeed, a financial crisis has been brewing for several months. The halving of the global oil price - undercutting Kurdistan's main source of revenue - and the effect of the war have both had a deleterious effect, especially after fighting in August saw the black flags of Islamic State (IS) come just 19 miles (30km) from Erbil, the capital of the Kurdish autonomous region in northern Iraq.\"When IS is at the door, logically it's hard to convince foreign investors that Erbil's safe and nothing's wrong,\" says Govan Haji Akravi, chief executive of Fastnet, an internet systems provider for foreign companies in the city. \"Almost from one day to another, many of them packed up and left.\" \n                        Some Kurdish fighters have not been paid for three months, says their commander, Faridon Jwanroyi\n                    \n                \n                        Islamic State fighters came within 19 miles (30km) of the regional capital Erbil last summer\n                    \n                Displaced peopleThere's also been a major refugee crisis. Some one-and-a-half million displaced people have arrived in Kurdistan, fleeing the fighting in Syria and northern Iraq. That's a 30% increase in the population of the region, leading to huge extra stresses, I'm told, on local services like water and education. The refugees are mostly housed in improvised camps. One of the more bizarre is the Ankawa Mall - a half-built shopping centre on the outskirts of Erbil. Like many building projects, it was abandoned by its developer as the crisis hit last year. Now the raw concrete shell is occupied by some 4,000 Iraqi Christians from the Mosul region, sleeping in alcoves created for designer boutiques. A makeshift wickerwork crucifix hangs over the entrance. One of the refugees, Issa, charges about 30 cents for a haircut and shave in his makeshift barber's shop in the main atrium at the foot of two massive escalators that are now derailed and disintegrating. \"I'm cheaper than the Kurdish barbers here,\" he tells me. \"No one wants to look hairy like the guys from Islamic State, so they come to me!\" he laughs. But the smile quickly fades. Life in the shopping centre is miserable, he says: \"It's like a camp for chickens.\" He dreams of escaping to Europe.    \n                        About 1.5 million refugees have fled to Kurdistan\n                    \n                \n                        The population of the region has risen by 30%\n                    \n                \n                        \"No one wants to look hairy like the guys from Islamic State,\" says Issa, a barber in one of the refugee camps\n                    \n                Dispute with BaghdadPerhaps the biggest economic challenge for Kurdistan stems from its troubled relations with central government. For the last year, Baghdad has only fitfully been paying the regional government in Erbil its share of the national budget. Under the constitution, Baghdad requires the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) to share its own oil production with the rest of the country. The Kurds should then be reimbursed with 17% of the total nationwide budget, which is currently set at $105bn (\u00a371bn).  Baghdad has accused Erbil of selling oil illegally, without its authority, and of failing to meet production quotas - allegations the Kurds deny. \"Baghdad knows very well we are selling oil - we have to pay people's salaries,\" says Dr Ali Sindi, the KRG's minister of planning. \"Meanwhile five million Iraqi citizens have been cut off from their rightful share of the nation's resources. This is a threat to the stability and the sustainability of the region,\" he says.The anger in Kurdistan is all the greater since Baghdad is continuing to pay salaries to government workers living under Islamic State. Even some refugees - civil servants displaced from Mosul - are, it is said, receiving their salaries from within the camps, whilst some of those caring for them haven't been paid since December.In the last three weeks, Baghdad has announced a breakthrough, saying it is renewing budget payments, although so far these amount to less than half what is owed for just March alone. Salaries for most workers, including soldiers, remain many months in arrears. The Iraqi Prime Minister, Haider Al-Abadi, has been quoted as blaming delays on a wider economic crisis in Baghdad. \n                        Under Iraq's constitution, the Kurds have to share their own oil output with the rest of the country\n                    \n                \n                        Kurdistan should be getting $105bn (\u00a371bn) from the central government in Baghdad\n                    \n                'We don't give up'\"If we don't reach a lasting solution, we will have to handle it through our own export of oil,\" says Dr Sindi. Kurdistan is this month said to be completing a new pipeline to its northern neighbour, Turkey. But despite the threats, few in Erbil believe Kurdistan has the political power to cut its own deals with the wider world.  In the meantime, some state employees are getting desperate. Civil servant Najad Amin and his wife Iqbal say they expect the last of their savings to run out in the next month. They've started growing vegetables in their back garden, to help feed the family. Do they blame the politicians in Baghdad or in Erbil, I ask?\"They're all to blame,\" they say. \"But we Kurds are used to depending on ourselves. We will find a way. We don't give up, absolutely.\" \n    ","pubdate":"Fri, 10 Apr 2015 04:45:26 +0530","newspaper":"BBC"},{"title":"Cybersecurity v human rights in Africa","content":"\n                        As internet usage rises in Africa, so does cybercrime\n                    \n                Think cybercrime and Africa, and most people in the developed world think of the notorious 419 email scam.This involves gangs extorting money from the likes of great aunt Mabel by promising her riches, if she'll just send some cash and\/or her bank details to a nice man in Nigeria. But cybercrime on the continent has moved far beyond this, with gangs embracing more sophisticated ways to use technology, such as malware and botnets, to get what they want.Internet usage is rising rapidly in Africa, and with it, cybercrime.This growth is making it easier than ever for criminals to operate. And it has created a new pool of potential victims lacking the knowledge and experience to be able to protect themselves effectively.VictimsSecurity expert Kaspersky says more than 49 million cyber-attacks took place on the continent in the first quarter of last year, with most occurring in Algeria, ahead of Egypt, South Africa and Kenya.But cybercrime is actually most pervasive in South Africa, with security firm Norton saying 70% of South Africans have fallen victim to cybercrime, compared with 50% globally.McAfee, another cybersecurity firm, reported that cybercrime cost South African companies more than $500m (\u00a3340m) last year.\n                        In South Africa 70% of people have been victims of cybercrime, says Norton\n                    \n                Baby stepsAfrica has long lacked a legal framework for tackling cybercrime.But in June 2014, the African Union (AU) approved a convention on cybersecurity and data protection that could see many countries enact personal protection laws for the first time.For it to be implemented, however, 15 of the 54 AU member states will need to ratify the text. As yet, not one country has done so, though there is optimism it will happen in the next three-to-five years. \"Cybersecurity is a growing concern for the nations of the African Union as more people come online,\" says Drew Mitnick, junior policy counsel at human rights organisation Access, which has called on member states to ratify the convention as soon as possible.\"It is critical for the countries to adopt cybersecurity policies that better protect users while respecting their privacy and other human rights.\" \n                        The African Union (AU) is made up of 54 member states - only Morocco doesn't belong\n                    \n                Access believes the AU should lead these efforts. The group has tracked proposed cyber and data protection laws in Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritania, Morocco, Tanzania, Tunisia and Uganda. In each case, the legislation would either fail to provide basic protection for user data, or allow the government to violate the rights of privacy, expression, and assembly, Access believes.But Beza Belayneh, managing director of the African Cyber Risk Institute (ACRI), says there are positives.\"[The convention] is a jumpstart for many countries who do not have any legal ground or appreciation to combat cybercrime,\" he says.\"It is a good guide to develop... computer or cybersecurity laws in a localised manner. It is the best way just to start the job. It has to start somewhere.\"It is apparent that many, if not all, African countries lack the capabilities to defend their ever-growing cyber infrastructure.\"Cybersecurity is finally receiving the attention it deserves, he added.Ducks in a rowAs a guide to helping African nations get their \"cyber ducks in order\", as Mr Belayneh puts it, the AU convention isn't too bad. Mr Mitnick says the convention contains a data protection provision covering control of personal data, with a large part of it mirroring the data protection framework and language developed by the European Union.He also commends the protection of human rights. \"The text requires governments to uphold the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, along with other basic rights such as \"freedom of expression, the right to privacy, and the right to a fair hearing, among others,\" he says.\"The inclusion of privacy is most welcome, considering it is not explicitly found in the African Charter.\"\n                        The AU proposals include giving judges unlimited power to issue search and seizure warrants on data or computers - causing understandable concern about human rights\n                    \n                'Negative effects'However, there are real concerns about some of the provisions. The Centre for Intellectual Property and Information Technology Law at Strathmore University, Kenya, is against implementation in its current form.It believes the convention could limit freedom of expression and allow authorities to intercept private data too easily. Judges would be given unlimited power to issue search and seizure warrants on data or computers, for example.All this could have \"substantial negative effects on online economies and social cultures across Africa,\" it says.\n                        A woman uses a tablet at an internet cafe in Dakar, Senegal\n                    \n                Mr Belayneh agrees that the document gives too much power to judges and law enforcement arms of governments, and says it fails to take into account the roles of education and consultation in combating cybercrime.\"It was written by lawyers,\" he says. \"Cybersecurity and cybercrime need a multi-sectoral approach - cybersecurity educators, researchers, NGOs [non-governmental organisations], vendors, ethical hackers were supposed to be involved so they could present a multi-dimensional framework instead of legal paper.\"\n                        Does criminalising \"insulting language\" allow governments to clamp down on dissent?\n                    \n                Some of the convention's phrases seem to be in direct conflict with protecting human rights. For instance, while the convention limits the processing of personal data, it contains an exception for a task \"carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority\" - a loophole ripe for abuse, some experts believe.Mr Mitnick says the convention could also pave the way for harsh criminal convictions. \"In one example, it limits the use of insulting language, which could describe a significant portion of the language on the internet and is likely to lead to subjective prosecutions,\" he says.Though the experts believe the convention is satisfactory as a first step, the negatives are certainly clear for all to see. \n    ","pubdate":"Fri, 10 Apr 2015 04:48:55 +0530","newspaper":"BBC"},{"title":"Pfizer walks away from $118 billion AstraZeneca takeover fight","content":"\n\nLONDON\/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer abandoned its attempt to buy AstraZeneca for nearly 70 billion pounds ($118 billion) on Monday as a deadline approached without a last-minute change of heart by the British drugmaker.\nThe decision ends a month-long public fight between two of the world's biggest pharmaceutical companies that sparked political concerns on both sides of Atlantic over jobs and corporate tax maneuvers.British rules now require an enforced cooling-off period. AstraZeneca could reach out to Pfizer after three months and Pfizer could take another run at its smaller British rival in six months time, whether it is invited back or not.Pfizer's move came two hours before a 5.00 pm (1200 ET) deadline to make a firm offer or walk away, under UK takeover rules. Its decision to quit the stage, at least for now, had been widely expected after AstraZeneca refused its final offer of 55 pounds a share.\"Following the AstraZeneca board's rejection of the proposal, Pfizer announces that it does not intend to make an offer for AstraZeneca,\" Pfizer said in a short news release.The biggest U.S. drugmaker promised it would not go hostile by taking its offer directly to AstraZeneca shareholders, leaving the fate of what would have been the world's largest ever drugs merger in the hands of its target, whose board would have had to make a complete U-turn to get a deal done.\"We continue to believe that our final proposal was compelling and represented full value for AstraZeneca based on the information that was available to us,\" said Ian Read, Pfizer's chairman and chief executive.Pfizer's final offer was at a price that many analysts and investors had previously suggested would bring AstraZeneca to the table for serious negotiations.\n        \n        But in rejecting an earlier offer of 53.50 pounds as undervaluing the company, the British group indicated it needed a bid more than 10 percent higher, or at least 58.85 pounds per share, for its board to consider a recommendation.Pfizer had urged AstraZeneca shareholders to agitate for engagement and several expressed disappointment at its intransigence, although others - encouraged by AstraZeneca's promising drug pipeline - backed the firm's standalone strategy.AstraZeneca Chairman Leif Johansson welcomed Pfizer's decision to back down, which he said would allow the British company to focus on its growth potential as an independent company.What happens next will depend upon whether AstraZeneca's share price deteriorates in the coming weeks and how hard its shareholders push for it to revisit a deal with Pfizer.BlackRock, AstraZeneca's biggest shareholder, backed the board's rejection of Pfizer's 55 pounds a share offer, but urged it to talk again in the future.POLITICAL OPPOSITIONThe proposed transaction ran into fierce opposition from politicians in Britain, Sweden - where AstraZeneca has half it roots - and the United States over the likelihood that the marriage would lead to thousands of job cuts.Ultimately, it was price and the lack of room for eleventh-hour maneuvering by Pfizer that killed the deal.Pfizer had several reasons for taking aim at AstraZeneca for what would have been its fourth mega-merger in 14 years.Highest on the list appeared to be Pfizer's desire to take part in a recent trend of so-called tax inversions, under which it could reincorporate in Britain and pay significantly lower corporate tax. Pfizer would also be able to use tens of billions of dollars it has parked overseas, avoiding high U.S. taxes for repatriating the huge cash pile.Pfizer also had its eye on a promising portfolio of drugs in AstraZeneca's developmental pipeline, especially several potentially lucrative cancer medicines.It was this pipeline that AstraZeneca management used to make its case for Pfizer significantly undervaluing the company.Chief Executive Pascal Soriot went as far as making a 10-year forecast for a 75 percent rise in sales by 2023.\"As we said from the start, the pursuit of this transaction was a potential enhancement to our existing strategy,\" Pfizer's Read said. \"We will continue our focus on the execution of our plans, bringing forth new treatments to meet patients' needs and remaining responsible stewards of our shareholders' capital.\"The merger would have restored Pfizer as the world's largest drugmaker by sales, a position it relinquished to Swiss-based Novartis when billions of dollars in annual revenue evaporated after its top-selling cholesterol fighter Lipitor began facing generic competition in 2011.(Editing by David Evans and Mark Potter)","pubdate":"Mon, 26 May 2014 21:25:17 +0530","newspaper":"Reuters"},{"title":"See you later?

The support of just 5 percent of shareholders is needed to call such a meeting.Even if shareholders wanted to revive the bid - or oust the board - an EGM would not come in time to rescue the current process before the takeover rules deadline, but they could force AstraZeneca to open communications with Pfizer in late August, after a compulsory three-month cooling-off period.\"Some of the more active hedge funds, instead of selling out are buying in,\" said one hedge fund investor. \"There has been sufficient shareholder dissatisfaction about this deal that investors can use that to get a favourable outcome further down the road.\"The only way a deal could be salvaged this month would be for AstraZeneca Chairman Leif Johansson and his board to make a complete U-turn and recommend Pfizer's current 55-pound offer, which looks out of the question.More leading shareholders spoke out publicly on the deal on Wednesday, but they didn't speak with one voice, underlining the challenge facing the Pfizer camp in trying to stir an investor rebellion.\n        \n        Threadneedle Asset Management came out in support of AstraZeneca's stance, while investment and insurance group AXA said the board should not have prevented Pfizer's offer being put to investors.The AXA view was echoed by Legal &amp; General, according to the Wall Street Journal. An L&amp;G spokesman confirmed to Reuters that the fund manager had talked to both companies but declined to comment further.EVENLY BALANCEDTo date, investors representing around 10 percent of AstraZeneca's share base have spoken out against the board's decision, with a similar number broadly lending their support, according to Thomson Reuters data.At more than 44 pounds, the shares remain well short of Pfizer's offer but a fair way above the undisturbed price of 37.82 pounds seen before news of Pfizer's interest emerged in mid-April.A recent run of favourable clinical trial news about AstraZeneca's new drugs has also supported the stock, with UBS issuing a note on Wednesday setting a price target for the shares of 50 pounds, without a Pfizer deal.Analysts at Barclays, who have a 40 pounds target, said in a note that the market was pricing in a probability of around 15 percent that there would eventually be an agreed deal with Pfizer valuing AstraZeneca at some 60 pounds.The U.S. company's ambitions to create the world's largest drugmaker - and slash its tax bill in the process - appeared within reach at one point in talks between the two sides last weekend, with AstraZeneca indicating a desired price of 58.85 pounds.But AstraZeneca's Johansson told Reuters on Monday that Pfizer had closed down discussions after a telephone call lasting more than an hour on Sunday and had surprised AstraZeneca by issuing its final offer later that night.(Reporting by Ben Hirschler; Editing by Will Waterman)","pubdate":"Wed, 21 May 2014 23:53:11 +0530","newspaper":"Reuters"},{"title":"AstraZeneca rejects Pfizer's take-it-or-leave-it offer","content":"\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Britain's AstraZeneca on Monday rejected a sweetened and \"final\" offer from Pfizer, puncturing the U.S. drugmaker's plan for a merger to create the world's biggest pharmaceuticals group.\nThe rebuff came nine hours after Pfizer said on Sunday night it had raised its takeover offer to 55 pounds a share, or around 70 billion pounds ($118 billion) in total, and would walk away if AstraZeneca did not accept it.The rejection left some major shareholders fuming as shares in AstraZeneca slumped 11 percent to close at 42.88 pounds after falling as much as 15 percent - their biggest ever intra-day decline. Pfizer rose 1 percent in New York.AstraZeneca Chairman Leif Johansson told Reuters he now saw no prospect of a deal with Pfizer before a deadline of May 26 set under British takeover rules, or any likelihood of that deadline being extended.Experts also said Pfizer had left itself no room to return with a last-minute higher offer due to the strict takeover code.Pfizer wants to create the world's largest drugs firm, with a headquarters in New York but a tax base in Britain, where corporate tax rates are lower than in the United States. The plan has met entrenched opposition from AstraZeneca, as well as politicians and scientists who fear cuts to jobs and research.\"It died of multiple wounds. Too little cash, too many suspicions about Pfizer's motives, and too little confidence in its assurances about jobs,\" said Erik Gordon, professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. \"Pfizer's chances are going down, despite its offer of a higher price.\"Johansson said he had made clear in discussions with Pfizer that his board could only recommend a bid that was more than 10 percent above an offer of 53.50 pounds made by Pfizer on Friday, which would amount to at least 58.85 pounds. He blamed Pfizer for calling a halt to discussions after a telephone call lasting more than an hour with Pfizer's chairman and CEO Ian Read on Sunday afternoon.\n        \n        In addition to the inadequate price, Johansson also slammed what he said was a lack of industrial logic behind Pfizer's move; the risks posed to shareholders by the controversial tax plans; and the threat to life science jobs in Britain, Sweden and the United States.\"Pfizer's approach throughout its pursuit of AstraZeneca appears to have been fundamentally driven by the corporate financial benefits to its shareholders of cost savings and tax minimization,\" Johansson said in a statement.\"From our first meeting in January to our latest discussion yesterday, and in the numerous phone calls in between, Pfizer has failed to make a compelling strategic, business or value case.\"But many of Johansson's shareholders were deeply unimpressed. \"We do not think the Astra management have done a good job on behalf of shareholders,\" said one fund manager at a top-10 investor in the group.Alastair Gunn of top-30 shareholder Jupiter Fund Management said: \"We are disappointed the board of AstraZeneca has rejected Pfizer's latest offer so categorically. They should have at least engaged in a constructive conversation with Pfizer.\"However, Pfizer's proposed takeover, which would be the largest-ever foreign acquisition of a British company, is opposed by many scientists and politicians who fear it would undermine Britain's science base.The U.S. group said its new offer was final and could not be increased. It said it would not make a hostile offer directly to AstraZeneca shareholders and would only proceed with an offer with the recommendation of the AstraZeneca board.Pfizer had also increased the cash element in its offer to 45 percent, under which AstraZeneca shareholders would get 1.747 shares in the enlarged company for each of their AstraZeneca shares and 24.76 pounds in cash.The new offer represents a 15-percent premium over the current value of a cash-and-share approach made on May 2 - worth 50 pounds a share at the time - which was also swiftly rejected by AstraZeneca.Pfizer's Read said he believed his proposal was \"compelling\" for AstraZeneca shareholders and expressed frustration at its refusal to talk, urging the British company's shareholders to pressure its board to engage.TAKE A BREAKIn the absence of further discussions or an extension of the deadline for making a firm offer under British takeover rules, Pfizer's proposal will expire at 5 p.m. (1600 GMT) on May 26. After that, it would have to wait six months before making another bid.\"AstraZeneca will have six months to demonstrate that it was right to reject Pfizer's offer, or face the prospect of a fresh approach,\" said analyst Mick Cooper at Edison Investment Research.While Pfizer would have to wait on the sidelines until November, it would be possible for AstraZeneca to initiate talks from late August, if it decided it wants coax a higher offer.The latest increased offer had been widely expected. Pfizer said last week it would consider a higher offer as it urged AstraZeneca's board to enter talks.The British firm has laid out details of its pipeline of new drugs and argues it has no need for a deal. However, many analysts believe its projections that it can increase sales by 75 percent to $45 billion a year by 2023 are over-optimistic.There has been a mounting political backlash against the proposed deal in Britain, the United States and Sweden, where AstraZeneca has half its roots.The Swedish government launched a concerted effort on Friday against a merger that it fears will lead to cuts in science jobs and research, echoing concerns aired by British lawmakers at two parliamentary hearings last week, and fears for U.S. jobs in states where AstraZeneca has a large presence.British Prime Minister David Cameron has said he wanted more assurances from Pfizer, in the event of a takeover, although as the head of the free-market Conservative Party he does not want to be seen to be deterring foreign corporate investment.Pfizer gave a five-year commitment to complete AstraZeneca's new research centre in Cambridge, retain a factory in northern England and put a fifth of its research staff in Britain, but added that these pledges could be adjusted if circumstances changed \"significantly\".The tax aspects of the deal, meanwhile, have sparked anger in the United States, where lawmakers are now considering legislation to prevent what are known as corporate inversions, under which U.S. companies re-incorporate overseas to avoid U.S. taxes.Inversions have helped fuel a wave of deals in the pharmaceuticals sector in recent months.

Then a second parliamentary committee on May 14 will question both CEOs again, along with British science minister David Willetts, about the science aspects of the deal.In response to worries about safeguarding the British company's research, Pfizer's R&amp;D head Mikael Dolsten posted a video on Pfizer's website saying he had been through five different mergers which did not disrupt drug research.\"If you keep your sense of curiosity and an open mind, you can learn tremendously,\" he said.\"We must stay laser-focused on our important projects. And that's, of course, true for Pfizer scientists and AZ scientists and will be true also if we can make a potential combination come together.\"Dolsten said there was \"a really great fit\" with the products that AstraZeneca had in its portfolio, with potential for combining drugs in areas such as lung cancer to offer much more effective treatments.There is considerable skepticism about Pfizer's long-term commitment to British jobs, given its record of cost cutting after past acquisitions and after it said it could adjust those promises if circumstances change \"significantly.\"But Pfizer said the fact it had made the promises as part of its offer made them legally binding and the pledges should be given \"full weight\".Prime Minister David Cameron said on Sunday he had made \"very good progress\" in securing guarantees from Pfizer, though the firm's latest statements contained no new offers.SWEETENED OFFER?Pfizer is widely expected to come back with a sweetened offer for AstraZeneca this week, though people familiar with the matter said it was likely to wait until after the parliamentary select committee hearings.The British group rejected a May 2 cash-and-stock offer worth 50 pounds a share from its larger American rival, and CEO Soriot has been on a roadshow to meet leading investors and lay out his strategy for a prosperous independent future.Soriot has secured the backing of several high-profile shareholders, but others have told Reuters they would like him to engage with Pfizer if the U.S. group makes an improved offer.In addition to wanting a higher price - many analysts think Pfizer will have to offer around 55 pounds a share - investors are also keen to increase the proportion of cash in any deal from 32 percent at present.Pfizer is limited in the amount of cash it can offer since in order to keep the tax advantages of re-domiciling to Britain it must ensure at least 20 percent of the enlarged group is British-owned.Under British takeover rules, Pfizer has until May 26 to make a firm bid for AstraZeneca or walk away.A slide in Pfizer's share price following its first-quarter results last week has reduced the current value of its May 2 offer to just under 48 pounds.

And though revenue from in-game purchases was up, monthly unique payers - gamers who actually spend money in King's titles - dropped to 11.9 million from 12.2 million in the previous quarter.Moreover, King's net profit of $127 million, was up from $53 million a year ago, but slipped 20 percent from $159 million in the previous quarter. On a call with analysts, executives said the company incurred expenses in marketing its new \"Farm Heroes Saga\" game in the first quarter.King's shares dropped to $16.25 in late afternoon trading. The stock has not approached its IPO price of $22.50 since it began trading in March.Arvind Bhatia, an analyst with Sterne Agee, said Candy Crush was fading sooner than expected. \"Other games made up for it ... if you are looking at it glass half full,\" he said.\"But if you are looking at the glass half empty, you'd say their core flagship is declining really fast,\" Bhatia said. \"All the pressure is on the new games and there's no guarantee they will be sustainably successful.\"If it fails to cultivate a suite of hits beyond its marquee title, King may be unable to dodge the fate of \"Farmville\" maker Zynga Inc and \"Angry Birds\" developer Rovio Corp, which are both struggling to retain players.\"What matters is if each quarter, the rate of growth of their other games offsets the rate of decline in Candy Crush and they are diversifying and they are no longer a one-hit wonder,\" Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said.DOWNHILL RACERSInvestors have long warned about the fickle nature of the mobile gaming industry, where titles can race to the top of app-downloads charts but go downhill just as quickly.\"You can have hits and once they start declining, they decline in a very fast spurt,\" Bhatia said.King plans to launch new titles in the second half of the year, including a version of Candy Crush for the Chinese market this summer. It will also release sequels to Candy Crush and its \"Bubble Witch Saga\" game.Farm Heroes Saga, which debuted on mobile devices in January, has quickly become one of the top-10 grossing games on Apple's and Google's app stores. But whether it continues to retain users, and King's new offerings are successful, remains to be seen.\"The decline of Candy Crush Saga will be more than offset by our new IP (games),\" King's Chief Executive Officer Riccardo Zacconi told analysts.London-based King's first-quarter revenue rose three-fold to $606.7 million from the year-ago period while net profit rose to $127.2 million, or 41 cents per share from $52.7 million, or 16 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding items, King earned 61 cents per share.

Are you going to get more involved at Newport Beach,\" Speich added, referring to Pimco's California base nearly 6,000 miles from Allianz's Munich headquarters.Three top shareholders told Reuters they want Allianz to rethink the six-person management structure put in place at Pimco after El-Erian's departure and provide greater detail on Pimco's long-term plan to broaden its focus beyond fixed income, among other things.Some shareholders think Gross, known on Wall Street as the Bond King, has been given too much freedom by Allianz, which bought the firm for $3.3 billion in 2000.Historically, Pimco's success has worked wonders for Allianz. In the past decade alone, Pimco's contribution to the German group's operating profit has climbed almost fourfold to 3.2 billion euros ($4.46 billion), representing a third of total core earnings. Allianz now sells nearly two thirds of its investment products to North American clients.Over the past year, however, Gross has shown signs of losing his touch. In a difficult year for bond markets, Gross's flagship Pimco Total Return Fund lost 1.9 percent in 2013, its first annual loss since 1999 and worst performance since 1994, according to Morningstar.Allianz has said little publicly until now about Pimco's performance or the internal disagreements at the fund manager.The insurer's head of investor relations, Oliver Schmidt, said in an interview published on Allianz's website that the company is working to address investor concerns about asset management and the fallout from rock-bottom interest rates.\"We are currently in the midst of extensive discussions with investors regarding both our investment and our product strategy,\" Schmidt said.Investors are also keen to hear plans about Allianz's own management, given that the contracts of six of its 11 board members - including Diekmann - are due to expire at the end of the year. Diekmann, who turns 60 in December, has not indicated whether he wants to continue in the job.Allianz has previously said that its supervisory board would look at the board positions in October, far too late for investors who fear the delay may add to uncertainty surrounding the business.(Editing by Carmel Crimmins and David Goodman)","pubdate":"Wed, 07 May 2014 15:58:53 +0530","newspaper":"Reuters"},{"title":"HTC shares fall after guidance announcement","content":"Thomson Reuters is the world's largest international multimedia news agency, providing investing news, world news, business news, technology news, headline news, small business news, news alerts, personal finance, stock market, and mutual funds information available on Reuters.com, video, mobile, and interactive television platforms.

On a consolidated basis, more than 130 million shares changed hands - 10 times the daily average volume for the last 50 days.The lock-up agreement that expired this week applied to about 470 million shares, or 82 percent of Twitter's equity, held by insiders, venture capitalists and other investors. Twitter allowed one batch of shares to be sold in February, but that lockup governed only about 10 million shares, most of which were held by non-executive employees.\"The move is bigger than expected and is indicative of the negative investor sentiment towards Twitter right now,\" Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell told Reuters.Tuesday's reaction to Twitter's lock-up expiry was in sharp contrast to that of Facebook Inc in late 2012. Facebook shares jumped 13 percent on November 14 that year, when its lock-up expiry of roughly 800 million shares did not trigger an immediate wave of insider selling.Twitter's shares have been trading at all-time lows since April 29, when the company disclosed sagging usage metrics.Indeed, concerns about user growth and engagement levels have wiped out about half of Twitter's market value, more than $18 billion, since late December, even as it has hit revenue targets in the two quarters since it went public at $26 a share.The stock does not look cheap either, despite the declines. Before Tuesday's selloff, Twitter shares were trading at 323 times forward earnings per share, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. Facebook trades at about 39 times.\"I am starting to think that sentiment might have got too negative, but I don't see anything that can turn this around in the near term,\" Cordwell said.The largest holder of Twitter shares, private equity firm Rizvi Traverse, had no intention of selling when the lockup expired, a spokesman for the firm said on Friday.Rizvi Traverse, which owns about 85.2 million Twitter shares, could not be reached for comment on Tuesday.Lowercase Capital, which also holds a significant stake in Twitter, said Monday it had no intention of selling its shares.Twitter co-founders Jack Dorsey and Evan Williams and Chief Executive Dick Costolo said in April they did not plan to sell shares after the restrictions were lifted.Venture capital firm Benchmark, which holds a roughly 6 percent stake, has also said it would not sell its stake.But other major shareholders could see an opportunity to cash out, given that none of Twitter's insiders sold their shares during the initial public offering.Large shareholders include venture capital firms Union Square Ventures and Spark Capital.

It said on Friday that the U.S. firm's latest offer of 50 pounds a share \"substantially\" undervalued the company.The group has not ruled out a deal altogether, however, and people familiar with the matter said it was willing to talk if there were a compelling offer. Several large shareholders have told Reuters they would be open to a deal at a higher level.Shares in AstraZeneca were down 2.7 percent at 46.80 pounds at  11:10 am ET (1510 GMT).\n        \n        \"OVERLY OPTIMISTIC\"Sales are set to fall over the next three years as older medicines lose patent protection, slipping to $24.5 billion by 2016 and $23.6 billion in 2017, according to Thomson Reuters consensus analyst forecasts.AstraZeneca has previously said it disagrees with analysts and sees sales back up at last year's level by 2017. Now it is forecasting \"strong and consistent\" growth from 2017 to 2023, driven by new treatments for cancer, diabetes, heart disease and lung disorders.It also flagged up a possible therapy for Alzheimer's disease, a notoriously high-risk area for drug development.Growth in core earnings per share, which excludes certain items, is expected to exceed revenue growth during this period, it added.Jefferies analysts said the forecasts appeared \"overly optimistic\" but the detailed product breakdown might help raise the price and cash mix in any deal. In addition to a higher bid, AstraZeneca also insists there should be more cash than the 32 percent suggested by Pfizer, with the balance paid in shares.AstraZeneca launched its 10-year sales forecast defense salvo a day after Pfizer CEO Ian Read renewed his call for the British company's board to enter talks.Read insisted his offer was \"compelling\" and signaled he was now weighing all options, including a possible hostile bid or looking at other targets, though he stressed that buying AstraZeneca remained \"Plan A\".Pfizer's pursuit of AstraZeneca has created a political stir in Britain, with critics of the U.S. group's approach fearing that a takeover will lead to big cuts in drug research, despite assurances given by Pfizer to the government.Officials have said a deal would be a commercial matter for the two companies but business minister Vince Cable said Britain could use its powers to assess if a takeover was in the public interest, while lawmakers called on Pfizer's bosses to appear before parliament.CANCER FOCUSMost investor interest centers on AstraZeneca's experimental cancer medicines designed to boost the immune system. Such drugs promise to revolutionize treatment of many tumor types and would also complement Pfizer's line-up of oncology medicines.But AstraZeneca is lagging rivals such as Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, Merck &amp; Co and Roche Holding AG in this field.\"This is a company that has made significant progress in moving its pipeline forward over the last 18 months,\" said Alistair Campbell, an analyst at Berenberg Bank. \"Is it enough on a fundamental basis to justify the current share price? Personally, I don't think so - at least not without the certainty you need in terms of knowing clinical trial outcomes.\"Among individual products, AstraZeneca said heart drug Brilinta had the potential to deliver annual sales of around $3.5 billion by 2023, with diabetes and respiratory medicines both adding about $8 billion apiece.In cancer it forecast potential peak sales of $6.5 billion for its experimental immunotherapy drug MEDI4736 - the product that has excited most interest from investors and analysts.AstraZeneca said last month it planned to push ahead with late-stage Phase III testing of MEDI4736, following evaluation of positive Phase I data that will be presented at an American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) conference on May 30-June 3.The detailed presentations on this and other experimental cancer medicines will be important for AstraZeneca and rivals, and could move its shares - but may be just too late for the Pfizer bid battle.Pfizer has a deadline of May 26 to make a firm offer or walk away under British \"put up or shut up\" takeover rules.\"They've got drug candidates in what look to be really exciting areas,\" said Dan Mahony, a fund manager at Polar Capital, who raised his stake in AstraZeneca last year. \"But it is not clear to us yet who, across the industry, has the best drug.\"(Additional reporting by Anjuli Davies; Editing by David Stamp and Will Waterman)","pubdate":"Tue, 06 May 2014 21:35:17 +0530","newspaper":"Reuters"},{"title":"Lead underwriters start Candy Crush maker with \"buy\" ratings","content":"\n\n(Reuters) - The three lead underwriters of King Digital Entertainment Plc's IPO started coverage of the stock with \"buy\" ratings or the equivalent, two days ahead of the release of the \"Candy Crush Saga\" game maker's first results as a public company.\nKing Digital's shares rose 1.7 percent before the bell on Monday, at the expiry of a 40-day \"quiet period\" for underwriters to issue recommendations after the IPO.\"Candy Crush peaked in mid-2013, but we expect it to still have a long tail of monetization driven by updated content, increased distribution, and effective marketing,\" analysts at J.P.
