{"root": [{"content": "Biswajit Baruah, ET Bureau Mar 28, 2015, 04.07AM IST(Reflecting the mood, analysts\u2026) MUMBAI: Shares of telecom companies such as Bharti Airtel, Idea Cellular and Reliance Communications (RCOM) dropped more than 5% on Friday on fears of aggressive bidding for airwaves, a development that may exert pressure on companies' balance sheets and cash flow, and restrict their expansion plans. Reflecting the mood, analysts maintained a cautious outlook on the sector, saying fresh buyers should stay away from this space in the near-term. On Friday, the department of telecommunications (DoT) released details of bidders at the recently concluded airwaves auction, where the government mopped up Rs 1.1 lakh crore from the spectrum put up for auction. The prices for the spectrum were considerably higher than the reserve price, said analysts. \"Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular have paid a little more for the spectrum than what the markets were expecting,\" said Mayuresh Joshi, VP, (institutional) Angel Broking. \"Going forward, Reliance Jio's pricing for its services would be closely watched. However, investors should note that the overhang on telecom stocks over spectrum is probably over.\" Telecom stocks came under intense selling pressure on Friday \u2014 Bharti Airtel fell 5.64% to Rs 376. Idea Cellular dropped 4.96% to Rs 171 after touching new 52-week high of Rs 187 in early trade. RCOM touched a new 52-week low of Rs 56.90 before closing at Rs 58.25, down 3.56%, while Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) ended 1.54% lower at Rs 7.68. Shares of some telecom companies \u2014 Bharti Airtel, Idea Cellular \u2014 have had a good run in the past one year, gaining 21% and 23%, respectively, while Reliance Communications dropped 53%; all these stocks have underperformed the ET 100 Index which gained nearly 27% over the same period. \"We reiterate our cautious view on the telecom sector, given the stretched balance sheets, rising capital expenditure, regulatory pushback, Reliance Jio's launch overhang, and expensive valuations,\" said Vinay Jaising, analyst at Morgan Stanley. They are also sceptical of Indian telecom companies due to a number of structural issues such as cannibalisation of voice by data, rapid expansion and network operational cost to deliver data, pricing impact from the imminent entry of Reliance Jio, and stretched balance sheets due to spectrum prices. \"Telcos will further bloat their balance sheet with debt, which is already under severe strain. We maintain 'hold' rating for Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular with a price target of Rs 399 and Rs 167/share, respectively,\" said Amar Mourya, research analyst at IndiaNivesh.

The company has rewarded its investors by outperforming the benchmark index, Sensex, handsomely during this time. Kajaria Ceramics continues to grow at a fast pace. It has reported a 30 per cent growth in revenue in the third quarter of 2014-15 compared to the same quarter previous year. The net profit jumped 55 per cent because of a 29 per cent increase in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, and a fall in interest cost due to reduction in debt.  Analysts say Kajaria Ceramics will maintain its high growth in the coming years, largely because of conducive industry dynamics. For the past several years, the Indian tiles industry has been growing due to urbanisation, affordability of tiles, and consumers' focus on home aesthetics, aided by rising disposable incomes. This growth rate is expected to accelerate in the coming years because of the new government's increased focus on affordable housing and the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. Going by its performance, Kajaria should be able to beat the industry growth rates. In the next five years, Kajaria Ceramics is aiming to grow its revenue at a compound annual growth rate of 20 per cent. Close to 15 per cent of this growth will come from an increase in volume. The remaining will be a result of an increase in prices and a customer shift to premium brands. Kajaria Ceramics is also expanding capacity. It will be spending up to Rs 200 crore in the next fiscal year towards this purpose. Though the company will continue to focus on its tiles business, which accounts for 90 per cent of its turnover, it has entered the sanitaryware and sanitary-fittings segment. Its sanitaryware plant is already operational and is expected to reach full production by March 2015. Even though margins are expected to remain at the current 15 per cent-plus level, the fall in the natural gas price will bring down costs and should help the entire sector expand margins. The historical PE of 35 may appear high, but analysts say, because of the strong volume growth, pricing power, healthy margins and a strong balance sheet\u2014very low debt, which is being cut further\u2014it is justified. But, bear in mind, the company, and the entire Indian tiles industry, faces a threat from Chinese imports. Any policy shift that serves to boost tiles export from China, will adversely impact the entire industry, including Kajaria.

These companies are unlikely to reap the full impact of the festive season in the December 2014 quarter. The festive sales were split between September and December due to early Navratri and Diwali in 2014. Along summer and an early festive season led to a strong first half for these companies, giving many investors an impression that the demand has bounced back for discretionary products post-election. A base effect, thanks to lower sales in the year-ago period, also boosted the numbers and fuelled sentiment.  There was a growth of 27-57% in sales for the September quarter and 25-39% in the first half of FY15. The earnings growth figures were even higher. The result was a surge in stock prices (See table). But, random checks (while talking to dealers and mall outlets) suggest that the sales in the December quarter have been less than impressive. One spots a similar trend in other consumer discretionary sectors like passenger vehicles and two-wheelers. For instance, Hero Moto reported minus 2% growth YoY for the December quarter, Bajaj Auto recorded minus 1% growth YoY while M&amp;M closed the quarter minus 12% YoY growth. Maruti was an exception, generating a 12% growth YoY.

The tyre company's net profit went down by 17% compared to the corresponding period last year and by 22% compared to the preceding quarter. Lower volume from European markets (the region contributes around 50% of its sales volume) and the discounts offered to clients to compensate the fall in natural rubber prices are the primary factors behind the fall in net profit.  Balkrishna Industries could not take advantage of the lower prices of natural rubber in the second quarter because it had a huge inventory of rubber purchased at higher prices. Rising employee costs following partial commissioning of its new tyre plant with 1.5 lakh per annum capacity in Bhuj, Gujarat, was another factor. The recent correction in its price has brought the valuations of Balkrishna Industries to reasonable levels. In addition to the fall in price, analysts are getting bullish on this niche player because of its improving fundamentals. Its Bhuj plant is expected to become fully operational by April 2015. This will help the company to foray into much bigger radial tyres (expected to move up from 35 inches to 57 inches) and, therefore, its tyre portfolio will be more comprehensive. Radial tyres have higher realisations (3-4% higher) and with this new plant, its radial sales volume is expected to move up from around 30% now to above 40% over the next three years. Balkrishna Industries is also working towards increasing its global market share in the off -highway tyres (OHT) from 5% to 8% in the next three years. To realise this goal, the company plans to set up warehouses in the US and other overseas markets in the near future to increase its penetration levels. Though the global fall in agricultural product prices has resulted in less demand for new tractors (lower demand for OEM tyres), existing tractors continue to work (normal demand for tyres in the replacement segment , which is nearly 80% of its total sales volumes). New tractor sales are also expected to improve following the stability in the American farm sector reported recently. With around 90% of its revenues coming from exports, Balkrishna Industries will also benefit from the sudden depreciation of the rupee in the last six months.

Orient Cement's per tonne cement production cost is around 13% lower than the industry average. Therefore, the company could repeat its stellar performance in the third quarter of 2014-15 as well. In its second quarter sales, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) and net profit grew by 20%, 123% and 200%, respectively, compared to the corresponding period last year, or on a year-on-year basis. The company could also improve its third quarter EBITDA per tonne to `785, which is among the highest in the industry. The rise in EBITDA per tonne was due to the strong volume growth (up by 4% y-o-y) and improvement in realisations (up by 15% y-o-y). Orient Cement is a good long-term bet because of the infrastructure growth expected in the company's two key markets\u2014Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh\u2014in the coming years. Industrial demand is expected to pick up in Maharashtra following the initiatives by the new state government. Andhra Pradesh, however, is the best example of the amount of harm political uncertainties can do to even well-established companies. The market size of cement has shrunk to 13 million tonnes in the state from the peak levels of 18 million tonnes in 2008-09. However, due to the low cost of production, Orient Cement could increase its market share.  Cement consumption should jump in Andhra Pradesh in the coming years as massive construction projects are lined up at the new state capital. To benefit from this, the mid-sized cement company is in the process of increasing capacity through green-field and brown-field projects. The company's 3 million tonne green-field project in Gulbarga (northern Karnataka) is progressing smoothly. Its trial production and, subsequently, commercial production is expected from April 2015 and June 2015, respectively. This project also includes a 45MW thermal plant and a 7MW waste-heat-recovery plant. Despite the key advantages, such as low-cost cement production, high return on equity (ROE) and return on capital employed (ROCE), this stock is still attractively priced compared to its peers.

While its net profit rose by 50% year-on-year, it zoomed by 98% on a quarter-on-quarter basis. The rise in net profit was primarily due to two factors: first, there was a 316% y-o-y jump in its other income which was triggered by the profit it made from sale of investments. Second, the company reported 14% y-o-y increase in rating revenues, which was significantly higher than the 5% achieved by its main competitor Crisil during the period under consideration. In addition to the increase in surveillance income, Care also added 761 clients during the quarter and its total volume of debt instruments rated increased by 16% y-o-y.  Analysts are now getting bullish on the long-term (2-3 years) growth opportunities for the credit rating sector because it is best placed to benefit from the cyclical recovery in corporate capex and bank credit growth. The sector is already doing well because of the pickup in debt issuances in the recent past. According to Prime Database, debt placements during the first half of 2014-15 went up by 22% compared to the corresponding period last year. Another factor helping credit rating agencies is the improvement in credit environment. For example, Care's modified credit ratio (MCR) has improved from 1.05 times to 1.25 times in the second quarter, y-o-y. MCR is calculated by dividing the number of rating upgrades with downgrades. An increase in MCR means that the financials of the rated companies are stable and improving. With a turnaround in the economy, MCR is expected to improve further in the second half of 2014-15. With the revival in market sentiments, debt issuances are expected to rise manifold, increasing business opportunities for rating agencies like Care. Since the company provides 'grading' for equity public offerings, revival in stock market sentiments also bodes well for it. While analysts are bullish on the sector, Care is their preferred choice. This is so because it is the cheapest stock based on valuations and the recent correction has brought down its valuations further to reasonable levels. It is quoting at 35 times trailing price-to earnings ratio compared to 51 times for Crisil and 45 for Icra. Care is also continuing with its liberal dividend policy and has announced 650% dividend during the second quarter, taking the total interim dividend announced in 2014-15 to 710%.

The shares fell to 1,865.5 yen ($17) in the first few minutes of frenzied trading, erasing most of the gains made since the start of the year, in response to Sony's announcement, which came after Japanese  markets had closed Wednesday. The company, whose dual-listed shares slid nearly 7.0 per cent in  New York, blamed the ballooning loss estimate on struggles at its mobile phone business, where it said it would cut staff by 15 per cent, or about 1,000 jobs. Demand for Sony's smartphones has come under increasing pressure from rivals including  Samsung and Apple, which is releasing its newest  iPhone in several key markets, including  Japan, this week. Sony also said it would not pay dividends for the first time since its shares started trading in Tokyo in 1958. The company, whose  credit rating has been slashed to junk, has issued a string of downward earnings revisions over the past two years as it undergoes a sweeping overhaul led by chief executive Kazuo Hirai. The restructuring has included thousands of layoffs, exiting the personal computer business and liquidating assets that saw the $1.0 billion sale of its Manhattan headquarters. News that the company was heading for a 230 billion yen ($2.14 billion) net loss in the fiscal year to March 2015 comes only months after it tipped a shortfall of just 50 billion yen, citing a turnaround in its television unit. The announcement was likely to resurrect fears that what used to be the world's leading electronics company has a lot more work ahead to cast off years of losses. Hirokazu Kabeya, senior strategist at  Daiwa Securities in Tokyo, said the share plunge was inevitable after the firm's latest worrying forecast. \"Market players are getting used to (Sony's downward revisions) but a temporary fall was still unavoidable,\" he said. Sony has been cutting expectations for sales in the money-losing smartphone business amid weaker-than-expected results in emerging markets and the soaring presence of rivals in its home market. \"Other firms are also offering new products with innovative technology -- this business experiences dramatic changes in products and services,\" Hirai told reporters in Tokyo when asked about struggles in the mobile phone unit. \"The environment is changing and becoming more severe,\" he added. Hirai, who took over in 2012, said Wednesday that the firm would continue to focus on more profitable areas of its vast business, which ranges from televisions and portable music to a movie division and little-known insurance business. Despite his bid to slim down the firm, Hirai has repeatedly shrugged off pleas to abandon a money-losing television division, which he insists remains central to Sony's core business. Japanese manufacturers have suffered badly in their TV divisions as razor-thin margins and fierce overseas competition hammered profits. Kabeya at Daiwa Securities said Sony cannot afford to get into a price war with lower-cost rivals, including Chinese smartphone makers, or beat Samsung and  Apple in global market share. \"It is difficult to cut into the dominance of the big two: Samsung and Apple,\" Kabeya said. \"(Sony) would be wise to shift its business resources to where it is strong -- such as movies and music.\" Following Thursday's share price drop, investors may take a step back and see Hirai's efforts to slim down the company as a positive, Kabeya said. \"But it's unlikely we'll see a rapid turnaround and the company will likely continue to go through a difficult time for a while,\" he added.

Bullion has surrendered gains inspired by a weak US employment report last week as  Federal Reserve officials suggest a US rate hike in June could still be in play, lifting the dollar to three-week highs versus a basket of major currencies. Spot gold was steady at $1,194.51 an ounce by 0225 GMT, after hitting a session low of $1,192.30 on Thursday. Bullion is down 1.3 percent so far this week after pulling back from Monday's seven-week top of $1,224.10. US gold for June delivery was nearly flat at $1,194.40 an ounce. \"What is changing rapidly is people's expectations as the actual rate hike timing approaches,\" said Mark To, head of research at Hong Kong's Wing Fung Financial Group, who believes the Fed is on track to raise rates in June. Data on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits rose less than expected last week and the four-week moving average of claims hit its lowest level since 2000, suggesting an abrupt slowdown in job growth in March was likely a fluke. Investors tend to shun gold, which doesn't pay interest, when market expectations point to US interest rates rising. \"But whether the Fed raises rates in June or decides to wait till September is a moot point in our view since we think that once the first rate hike takes place, the Fed will likely stand aside for a period of time to see what the repercussions of its move will be,\" INTL FCStone  analyst Edward Meir said in a note. Gold could drop to a five-year low of $1,100 this year, before a recovery in 2016 spurred by Asian demand, GFMS analysts at  Thomson Reuters said. Demand from India and China, the world's top two gold consumers, has been slack so far this year, with Beijing's anti-corruption drive hurting Chinese appetite. Premium for physical gold at the Shanghai Gold Exchange stayed at just about a dollar over the global spot benchmark on Friday.

Brent crude rallied 4 percent intraday as European equities strengthened on German industrial output and trade data and Greece's repayment of a loan to the International Monetary Fund. Also supportive was Iran saying it will only sign a final nuclear accord if all sanctions imposed over its disputed nuclear program are lifted the same day. \"The German data provided some lift early because it comes even before the expected economic boost from central bank quantitative easing and any sign that an agreement with Iran isn't going to get done is bullish,\" said  Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. Dollar-denominated oil pared gains on the strong dollar, which was driven higher by sentiment that US  interest rates inevitably will rise. Brent May crude rose $1.02 to settle at $56.57 a barrel, having reached $58.02. US May crude rose 37 cents to settle at $50.79, after hitting $52.07. US crude's Tuesday close near $54 was the strongest since Dec. 30. \"The dollar's strength helped pull crude off the highs and the big jump in inventories is still a factor,\" said Gene McGillian, senior analyst at  Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.

An adviser to Saudi  oil minister  Ali al-Naimi struck a hopeful note on Thursday, saying that this price slide was temporary and that global oil demand was expected to grow annually by up to 1 million bpd. Iranian oil minister  Bijan Zanganeh said in  Beijing on Thursday that  OPEC would \"coordinate\" to accommodate Iran's return to oil markets without causing a price crash. OPEC's strategy of holding output steady is not working and members should discuss production levels before June's meeting, Zanganeh said.

Athens has until the end of the month to reach an agreement, with an April 24 meeting of eurozone finance ministers seen as the last chance for a deal. Despite making the payment, Greek  Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis remained typically defiant. \"We are not going to sign on the bottom line of whatever you're giving us just to get the (money),\" Varoufakis said on a visit to Paris. \"We are not promising anything just to get the next loan tranche,\" he added. From Moscow, where he is on a two-day official visit, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras called for an \"honourable compromise\" to ensure continued access to the European Union-International Monetary Fund bailout cash. \"I am confident that despite the difficulties, all the forces will come to an honourable compromise,\" Tsipras said. Athens had earlier authorised the loan repayment to the IMF after days of uncertainty. \"Yes, I've got my money back,\" IMF head  Christine Lagarde replied when asked at an Atlantic Council think tank event in Washington whether Athens had made the payment. \"What matters is now for the Greek authorities and the three institutions, the IMF, the ECB ( European Central Bank) and the  European Commission, to get on with the work,\" she said later on CNBC. Tsipras' decision to go on a Russia charm offensive -- while his government is locked in loan talks with its EU peers -- has irritated Greece's European partners. Athens is trying to persuade the EU and IMF to continue lending it money while easing austerity requirements in order to boost economic growth. After talks with President  Vladimir Putin on Wednesday, Tsipras also met Russian Prime Minister  Dmitry Medvedev on Thursday. Speaking to students in Moscow, Tsipras said his priority remained to reach a deal with the EU. \"The goal of the government is for Greece to remain in the euro. To remain in the eurozone. We consider this problem facing us a common European problem and for this reason we seek a joint European solution,\" the 40-year-old prime minister said. Experts from the IMF and the EU are scrutinising a list of economic reforms proposed by Athens in a bid to unlock another 7.2 billion euros in loans to stave off possible bankruptcy. The Greek government has insisted it can meet its payments, but Tsipras himself fuelled market fears when he warned German Chancellor  Angela Merkel in a letter last month that Athens would not be able to service its debt without more financial help from the EU. Later this month, Athens has to make interest payments of nearly 400 million euros and roll over 2.4 billion euros in six- and three-month treasury bills due to mature on April 14 and 17. Athens on Wednesday raised 1.14 billion euros in six-month treasury bills. On Thursday it announced the sale of another 625 million euros in three-month bills next week. Greek banks are dependent on the ECB for financing, but the eurozone's central bank no longer accepts Greek sovereign bonds as collateral for loans. The ECB on Thursday raised its emergency liquidity assistance to Greek banks by 1.2 billion euros to 73.2 billion euros. Since 2010, Athens has received two successive loan packages from the EU and the IMF worth up to a total 240 billion euros in exchange for tough austerity measures and sweeping economic reforms. In a sign of attempts by the new Greek government to make good on promises to ease the pain of austerity, parliament began Thursday considering the reinstatement of about 4,000 sacked state employees, ranging from police officers to bureaucrats. Putin and Tsipras exchanged warm words on Wednesday and a vague \"joint action plan\" on cooperation was agreed upon, but Putin insisted Athens had not asked for financial aid. Greece has been particularly hard-hit by the embargo slapped down last year in retaliation for sanctions imposed by the bloc against Moscow, as more than 40 percent of its exports to Russia were farm products. Although the embargo will remain, there was a sign of a potential compromise in the shape of a proposal to set up joint Russian-Greek companies based in Russia that would provide a loophole in the ban, according to a government source. Under the mooted arrangement, Greek fruits and vegetables would not be considered as exports. Also prominent on Wednesday's agenda was gas and energy cooperation, with Putin and Tsipras mentioning the possibility of Greek involvement in Moscow's new Turkish Stream pipeline project. Tsipras is expected to return to Russia for an economic forum in Saint-Petersburg on June 18-20. In Brussels, eurozone experts were on the second day of a working meeting Thursday poring over the reform plans Greece submitted at the end of March. The discussions were only making \"small steps\" a source said Wednesday.

The greenback has had an almost uninterrupted run against a basket of major currencies, rising almost 13 percent in 2014 and a further 9 percent this year on the view the Fed could raise rates as soon as in June. But that rally has stalled, hit by weaker US economic data in recent months, which, coupled with a more dovish central bank, has pushed market expectations for a rate hike to later in the year and possibly not until 2016. The latest poll of over 60 foreign exchange strategists taken this week suggested the dollar index will rise only 3 percent more by the end of 2015. \"A much more dovish than expected Fed post-the March  FOMC has created doubt about the USD bull market. However, the Fed's concern about a strong USD will delay, but not cancel, Fed normalisation,\" Jeremy Hale, head of macro strategy at Citi, said in a note. Still, if the dollar does rise by as much as expected, it would start to hurt the US economy, according to a smaller sample of analysts who answered an extra question. \"It (the dollar rally) is already hurting exports to some extent and the higher it goes, the more it hurts,\" said Dag Muller, financial markets analyst at  SEB. A separate Reuters poll of equity strategists last month forecast more modest gains for US shares this year than in 2014 as the firmer dollar not only drags on economic growth but threatens US corporate earnings. New York Fed President William Dudley told Reuters on Wednesday the central bank could still hike earlier than markets expect although he suggested the bar was higher for a June hike after a series of disappointing economic data. The minutes of the Fed's March meeting showed there was a wide divergence of views among policymakers and as such there is no real consensus on when the Fed will move. That suggests more volatility ahead in foreign exchange markets, especially given that the European Central Bank has just embarked on a quantitative easing programme to bring inflation back up towards its target. The poll predicted the euro will likely fall further over the next year after sliding 12 percent in 2014 and a further 11 percent so far this year. The single currency is seen holding near Thursday's trading level of $1.07 in a month. It is then expected to ease to $1.05 by end June and to $1.04 in a year. That is down from the March poll's consensus of $1.12, $1.10 and $1.08. In the latest poll, there are now more analysts calling for the euro to reach or fall below parity against the dollar compared to previous months. Others took a starkly different view, predicting an end to the euro's slide. Latest CFTC data showed currency speculators had piled up bets against the euro to a record high, suggesting the fundamental outlook will need to turn much more pessimistic for the single currency to fall any further. \"The current euro movement is a bit overdone, went too far, but there will be a slight pullback on that since we do not have an aggressive rate view on the U.S side,\" said Marko Elo, foreign exchange analyst at Pohjola Bank, one of the most accurate forecasters on the euro so far this year. Sterling is forecast at $1.47 in one month, $1.46 in three and then to gain slightly to $1.48 in a year, on expectations the Bank of England will trail the Fed in its first rate hike. That was also originally expected by mid-year but has now been pushed to late this year or early 2016. Britons go to the polls next month. When asked how the outcome of one of the closest-fought national elections in decades would affect sterling, most forecasters polled did not answer. Those who did had wildly conflicting views.

The company issued corporate non-convertible bonds for its 1,320 mw coal-fired power plant at Jhajjar in Haryana. The bond, which carries a 50% guarantee from CLP India, has a semi-annual coupon of 9.99% a year and has been issued in two series of equal amounts and will mature in April 2025 and April 2026. CLP India is the wholly owned subsidiary of Hong Konglisted China Light and Power Holdings. CLP entered the Indian power sector in 2002 with the acquisition of a 655 MW gas-fired power plant in Gujarat. \"The Jhajjar plant was financed in 2009 right after the global financial crisis when the cost of funds was very high. That was limiting the profitability of the project. The fund raised now will help us refinance our most expensive Rupee loan,\"  Rajiv Mishra, managing director, CLP India told ET. The Jhajjar plant was set up at a cost of Rs 6,300 crore, which included Rs 4,000 crore of debt. The funds raised would replace a long-term debt with interest rate of 13.5% and give a savings of almost 350 basis points on interest payment to the company. \"The innovative structure achieves the twin objectives of accessing long-term funds at competitive rates for the issuer and an attractive longterm investment opportunity for the investors.

Standard Chartered Bank and  IDFC Limited are the lead managers to the issue. Credit-enhanced bonds are debt instruments issued by lower-rated companies to improve the credit profile of their debt issuances. In this instance, Jhajjar Power first improved its credit rating to ' A+' from 'BBB' and then with the partial guarantee from parent CLP India, their rating was enhanced to ' AA+'. \"This is a first of its kind bond issuance and we see insurance companies are getting comfortable with such opportunity.

Once a month, she takes her two young children to McDonald's for inexpensive breakfasts or ice cream.\n\"We call it our 'sneaky meal' because my husband thinks it's absolutely disgusting,\" said Wood, 35. \"He doesn't want to know anything about it.\"Even though Wood has fond memories of her own childhood visits to McDonald's, that doesn't mean she thinks the food is healthy. At home, she buys organic milk and meat as often as a tight family budget allows.The fact that young mothers like Wood are teaching their children not to tell their dads that they've been to McDonald's may underscore how hard it may be for the world's largest restaurant chain to remake its image and revive U.S. sales. To lure back consumers, McDonald's Corp's (MCD.N) new Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook recently pledged to eliminate chickens fed human antibiotics at its U.S. restaurants.That won't make a difference for Wood, who said she's never eaten a Chicken McNugget and has no plans to try one, even after the antibiotic change.McDonald's didn't comment for this story. The company doesn't break out what percentage of its customers are young adults and/or mothers. \"There is still a negative health connotation,\" said Morningstar restaurant analyst R.J. Hottovy. \"It can be fixed, but it isn't an easy fix.\"Hottovy said he expects McDonald's to eventually turn around its business, but not within the next couple years. McDonald's shares fell 30 cents to $96.55 on Thursday. The shares are down 1.8 percent from a year ago, compared with a 11.7 percent gain by the benchmark Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index in the same period.Sixty percent of American adults would like more restaurants to serve antibiotic-free meat, according to a recent Reuters/Ipsos survey of 1,364 participants. Among parents with children under the age of 18, 40 percent said they would be more likely to take the kids to McDonald's if it had antibiotic-free chicken on the menu. The Reuters/Ipsos online poll was conducted between March 27 and 30, roughly two weeks after McDonald's announced its plan for antibiotics in chicken.According to another poll by Morgan Stanley of 3,000 U.S. adults, the cohort known as Millennials, generally defined as being 18 to 34 years old, care more about all-natural and organic ingredients than older generations. Millennials also are more likely than other groups to eat out on a weekly basis. And while they still eat more traditional fast food than other generations, they express more dissatisfaction with the category, according to the Morgan Stanley poll. That helps explain why chains like Chick-fil-A and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N), which have committed to sourcing 100 percent antibiotic-free meats, have been taking a bite out of McDonald's sales. More than one-third of parents who answered the Reuters/Ipsos poll said they take their children to McDonald's at most a few times a year.MULTIPLE MAKEOVERSA series of critical documentaries over roughly the last decade, including \"Super Size Me\" in 2004, amplified consumer concerns about the health effect of eating fast food. McDonald's has repeatedly tried to change that image. Among other things, it introduced salads to its menu and tweaked its Happy Meals for children by adding apple slices and cutting the french-fry portion by more than half.Last year, McDonald's sought direct feedback from its U.S. diners with an online campaign called \"Our food. Your questions.\" Frequent queries included \"Is 'pink slime' in a Chicken McNugget?\" and \"Why doesn't your food rot?\" Food industry experts have said the move toward mostly antibiotic-free chicken will accelerate similar efforts by other fast-food chains and major supermarkets. It may also help curb the rise of antibiotic-resistant superbugs that contribute to thousands of U.S. deaths every year.Samantha Trujillo, 33, a stay-at-home mother of four from Yuma, Arizona, said McDonald's vow to wean chickens off most antibiotics makes her feel a little bit better about the chain and its food.\"I probably would eat the chicken a little more often,\" said Trujillo, who takes her kids out every month or two to get Happy Meals and visit the air-conditioned play area for a respite from Arizona's sweltering heat.Asked whether McDonald's antibiotic move could move the needle for the company that saw 2014 revenue, profit and traffic fall, Mark Kalinowski, restaurant analyst for Janney Capital Markets, said: \"My best guess is that it'll help only a little bit at most.\"People who care about antibiotic-free meats want them to be completely antibiotic free, Kalinowski said. \"If you're going to do it, do it.

He hopes to save enough money to buy the sports version of the watch, he said.The Apple Watch sport starts at $349 while the standard version comes in at $549 in the U.S. High-end \"Edition\" watches with 18-karat gold alloys are priced from $10,000 and go as high as $17,000.\"I feel naked without a watch. I think I will buy the Apple watch with the sports band ... I'm working very hard right now so I can buy this watch,\" Bock told Reuters.The watch marks the Cupertino, California company's debut in a fledgling wearable technology market.Based on recent customer interest at its stores, Apple expects demand for the watch, which allows users to check email, listen to music and make phone calls when paired with an iPhone, to exceed availability at launch, it said on Thursday.Reviewers this week praised the watch, which also helps users monitor their health and exercise, as \"beautiful\" and \"stylish\" but gave it poor marks for relatively low battery life and slow-loading apps.For women, the various sizes and wrist bands make this smartwatch more pleasing than earlier versions from Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) and others, said Kantar World Panel market analyst Carolina Milanesi, who has been wearing the watch for a few days.At the Apple Store in Omotesando, a high-end shopping district in the heart of Tokyo, dozens of shoppers huddled around two glass displays, snapping pictures of the range of options available on the different watch models.\"I actually tried it on briefly, and it's so light it doesn't feel like it's on my wrist,\" 26-year-old salesman Yosuke Hosoi told Reuters.NOT FOR EVERYONESales estimates for 2015 vary widely. Piper Jaffray predicts 8 million units and Global Securities Research forecasts 40 million. By comparison, Apple sold nearly 200 million iPhones last year.\"Is it for everybody? No, but I don't think any wearables are yet,\" Milanesi said.Apple's watch is widely expected to outsell those by Samsung, Sony Corp (6758.T) and Fitbit, that have attracted modest interest from consumers. It will likely account for 55 percent of global smartwatch shipments this year, according to Societe Generale.Underscoring its marketing strategy, Apple is selling the watch through a handful of high-end stores including Selfridges in London, Galeries Lafayette in Paris and Isetan in Tokyo.Still, experts said Apple's offering was unlikely to displace the market share of luxury-brand watch makers.\"This is just Apple's interpretation of the watch, I don't think watch makers should be worried at all,\" Stephen Fenech, editor of the Tech Guide website, told Reuters.\"This is just Apple's expression where they've combined what they are good at with the fact that it's a watch with style so I think there's going to be room for everyone.\"JMP analyst Alex Gauna said he and others on Wall Street would be at stores this weekend to gauge consumer reaction.But the typically long queues at its stores on product launch days could be a thing of the past as the company emphasizes online sales, according to a leaked internal memo from retail chief Angela Ahrendts, reported by Business Insider.\"The days of waiting in line and crossing fingers for a product are over for our customers,\" she wrote.\"This is a significant change in mindset, and we need your help to make it happen. Tell your customers we have more availability online, and show them how easy it is to order.\"A spokesman for Apple in Sydney declined to comment on the memo, citing company policy.At an Apple Store in Hong Kong there was no queue, although half a dozen customers gathered near the shop door, cheering when it was opened. Demos were by online registration, after which a Reuters reporter received a demo without having to wait.\"I didn't know it's the first day. I am here to buy an iPad,\" said a 26-year-old customer who gave her name only as Ms Jian, visiting from China's Chongqing. \"I will take a look at the watch later.\"Apple shares closed 0.76 percent higher at $126.56 on Thursday.

Producer prices (PPI) fell slightly less than projected, contracting 4.6 percent rather than the forecasted repeat of February's 4.8 percent pace.The March inflation data is the first in a batch of key economic data that will climax with release of first-quarter growth numbers on April 15. A Reuters poll expects growth to be a six-year low of 7 percent.PRESSURE ON MARGINSPPI has now been in negative territory for three years, highlighting sustained pressure on profit margins at Chinese companies - in particular heavy industry - as Beijing struggles to restimulate headline growth.The higher-than-expected CPI was driven by a sudden rise in pork prices, which been a drag on CPI every month since December 2013.But consumer inflation is still far short of Beijing's official 3 percent target for 2015, and some economists see that goal at risk.\"Consumer price inflation held steady in March but we expect a drop in food price inflation to pull it lower over the coming months,\" wrote Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics in a research note.Producer prices were dragged down again by mining and raw materials components. Friday's data follows a surprise recovery in manufacturing activity for March, with the official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) edging up to 50.1, in expansionary territory, from February's 49.9.WORRIED POLICYMAKERSPolicymakers have publicly expressed worry that the risk of deflation is rising for the world's second-largest economy, as the drag from a property market downturn and widespread factory overcapacity is compounded by an uncertain global outlook and soft commodity prices.But while lower commodity prices have punished the extraction and power production sectors, the pain is not felt across the board, as some companies have taken advantage of lower input costs to maintain profit margins. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has made multiple cuts to guidance lending rates, and one cut to reserve requirement ratios at banks. It also launched a long-awaited deposit insurance program in April, but economists said those moves have had little impact on real borrowing costs.\"The weak inflation profile suggests that further monetary policy easing is still needed in spite of recent retreats of onshore money market rates,\" ANZ economists Zhou Hao and Liu Ligang wrote after Friday's data release.\"We believe that only permanent liquidity injection will be able to sustain the current favorable monetary conditions to head off the risk of deflation,\"  they said.The central bank has guided benchmark short-term money rates down sharply in recent weeks, and the interest rate yield curve has risen and steepened slightly as short term rates have fallen while longer term expectations have risen.

Until now.\nHe says a meeting with the new competition chief of the European Commission has left him with newfound hope that Brussels will take action at last to curb behavior by the U.S. Internet giant, which he blames for hurting his business.Danish politician Margrethe Vestager, who took over the EU competition portfolio in November, inherited an anti-trust complaint by more than a dozen companies against Google, left unresolved by her Spanish predecessor Joaquin Almunia.Almunia launched an investigation in 2010 and initially concluded that Google may have hurt competitors by favoring its own products and services in search results and blocking advertisers from moving their campaigns to rival platforms.Since then, Google has offered three settlement proposals to resolve the case. Most recently, just over a year ago, it offered to give competing products and services bigger visibility on its website, let content providers decide what material it can use for its own services and make it easier for advertisers to move their campaigns to rivals.Almunia initially accepted that deal, only to reverse his decision six months later and demand more concessions, leaving the ultimate decision to his successor.So far, Vestager has said nothing in public that would explicitly signal what course she is considering.She has also indicated that she will not rush into a decision. Asked whether enforcement regulators should emphasize quick action in cases involving fast-moving technologies, Vestager told Reuters: \"I don't think that speed should be the priority. We should be even handed and open minded in interpretation of the facts. Of course it is better to be fast than slow but it's even better to be just.\"Nevertheless, executives from some of the companies that brought the complaint against Google say they are more optimistic now than they have been for years, and that they believe action is finally coming soon.\"With Almunia, there was no real dialogue. With Vestager, it is different. The questions she asked us show that she understands the complainants' problems,\" said Weber.Another of the complainants, who spoke on condition of anonymity because a meeting with Vestager was confidential, said: \"The first thing she said at the meeting was that she understands the harm we have suffered.\"The European Commission declined to comment on the case.Google also would not comment. Spokesman Al Verney said he would not discuss anti-trust issues.HIGH STAKESThe stakes are high for Google which faces a fine of as much as $6.6 billion if found guilty of anti-competitive behavior. Even more disruptive, it may have to modify its business practices.Google's dominant positions in markets like online search, advertising and smartphone operating systems have drawn regulatory scrutiny in various jurisdictions around the globe.Its longstanding position is that competition is \"just a click away\" - a phrase meant to indicate that users have easy access to use rival services - and that its products are popular because people find them useful.Vestager, 46, was a free-trading economy minister in Denmark who jolted Danes with deep cuts to the social welfare system, earning a reputation as a firm negotiator before coming to Brussels.She has spoken in general terms of the need to keep fast-changing industries open and contestable and said both large and small players should be able to compete on the merits of their products, comments that some of the Google complainants have interpreted as sympathetic toward their case.They also note that she met some of the complainants before seeing Google's executive chairman Eric Schmidt and general counsel Kent Walker last month.In one sign of movement in recent weeks, the European Commission has asked some of the Google opponents to allow regulators to declassify some of the confidential data they submitted to justify their accusations, a step that would be necessary to present the data to Google for its response.Wilko van Weert, a partner at law firm McDermott Will &amp; Emery and specialist in the field, said Vestager could push for a settlement that would require Google to provide more information about its search ranking formula.\"Coming from a Scandinavian culture where transparency is very important, I would not be surprised if she pushes for maximum transparency in the way Google organizes and manages its search results,\" he said.Any ruling by Vestager might have to be able to survive a potential court challenge from Google, which could be tougher to withstand because of Almunia's previous reversals.Vestager may initially want to play hard ball, but that does not mean she will close the door to a settlement, said Mario Mareniello, a former economist at the Commission's competition unit and now an expert at think tank Breugel.\u201cIf at a certain point in the process effective remedies addressing her objections would be offered by Google, I guess it would be hard for her to say no,\u201d he said.

The plant currently employs 4,125, more than the required level, the city said.The city council is scheduled to hold a public hearing on April 14 to consider establishing a reinvestment zone at the location. The city has also proposed reducing taxes by 80 percent for 10 years on the expanded plant and its equipment and waiving building permit and development fees, according to a city staff report.The company, which is among the top 10 employers in Arlington according to the city's website, will spend $307 million on the physical expansion and $986 million on new equipment. \"GM is developing a business case for a potential future investment at Arlington Assembly. An investment would fund facility improvements aimed at strengthening the plant's manufacturing capability.

EU officials said the Greek delegate made an urgent plea for cash at a meeting of deputy finance ministers in Brussels on Wednesday evening but was told there must first be progress on a stalled list of measures to make public finances sustainable.\"From the Greek side there was a strong statement that liquidity is getting really bad and there was an appeal to release some type of liquidity support before the euro zone finance ministers' meeting on April 24,\" a euro zone aide said.\n        \n        \"But no one knows how this could be done -- there is no willingness to provide support before there is some progress in terms of the reform program,\" the official said.In a small short-term boost, the European Central Bank agreed to increase the ceiling on emergency lending assistance to Greek banks by 1.2 billion euros to 73.2 billion euros, a banking source told Reuters. The ECB is reviewing the limit weekly while euro zone negotiations continue.Leftist Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, elected on a promise to end austerity, is balking at politically sensitive reforms of the pension system and labor markets to which his conservative predecessor had agreed. EU sources said Brussels was pushing Athens towards more rapidly applicable measures to liberalize product and service markets instead.Greece's creditors -- the euro zone and the IMF -- are using the leverage provided by its acute cash predicament to press for those measures to be implemented.DETAILS, NUMBERS MISSINGA European Commission spokesman stressed the importance for Greece of the finance ministers' session in Riga, telling reporters: \"Obviously, everything that happens before April 24 in terms of reaching an agreement will be greatly welcome.\"Athens submitted a 26-page list of planned reforms last week but euro zone officials said they lacked key details and proper assessments of the financial implications.The officials said trust was so low that ministers would want to see legislation going through the Greek parliament, not just promises, before they released more funds.Varoufakis accused the euro zone of inflicting toxic medicine on his country, and starving it of cash. \"Tragically we find ourselves today in a similar situation,\" he told an economic conference. \"As a finance minister ... in order to create the liquidity which is necessary to see these negotiations through hopefully to a sustainable solution, I have to make the same request that we are allowed to issue T-bills over and above a certain limit to create the liquidity necessary to see us through to the end of the month or the next month or June, so as to be able to redeem payments to the former troika -- to the IMF in this case.\"A secret memorandum drafted by the finance ministry of Finland, one of the most hardline creditor countries, raised the prospect of Greece effectively being pushed out of the euro zone if fails to meet obligations under its 240 billion euro bailout program.The newspaper Helsingin Sanomat quoted the memo, dated March 27, as saying Helsinki must be prepared for the possibility that Greece would run out of cash before the end of June. That could lead to a situation where \"by silent approval of the other euro zone countries a process is started which in effect results in Greece being expelled from the euro\", it said. The finance ministry was not available for comment.On the second day of a visit to Russia, Tsipras said in a speech at Moscow University that Russia could not be an alternative \"solution\" for Greece's debt problems to negotiations with the euro zone.But he called on the European Union to restore dialogue with Moscow despite differences over Russia's role in Ukraine.\"It is impossible to build European security without Russia, let alone against it,\" Tsipras told students. \"In this context, we must ...\u00a0restart the EU-Russia dialogue in order to address global challenges, energy cooperation and to promote mobility among citizens.\"   (Additional reporting by Philip Blenkinsop and Ingrid Melander in Brussels, Renee Maltezou in Moscow and Anna Ercanbrak in Helsinki; Writing by Paul Taylor; Editing by Giles Elgood)", "newspaper": "Reuters", "id": 43, "pubdate": "Thu, 09 Apr 2015 21:41:36 +0530", "title": "Greece makes IMF payment, gets bank funds, but doubts remain"}, {"content": "&#13;\n         &#13;\n    &#13;\n\t&#13;\n\tIf you have just finished studying at a top global university, the Indian financial markets may not be the place for you.\u00a0&#13;\n&#13;\n\tThose who have studied from top-tier financial market education institutions including the London School of Economics, Yale, Oxford or Cambridge would all fail to meet the criteria for research analysts in India.

The key short-term monitorable are the monsoons, as it plays a key role in cash flows and the purchasing power of farmers. Bad news on this front could worsen the situation.\u201cWe see little chances of a positive earnings surprise in FY16 for stocks levered to the rural economy. In the near term, one should be underweight the (basic) rural plays, given that erratic rainfall has damaged two crops in succession, low levels of activity (construction, mining) and rationalisation of subsidies have impacted non-farm incomes, and land price increases have moderated and fallen in a few places,\u201d says Suhas Harinarayanan, head of research, JM Financial Institutional Securities.Notably, key statistics such as tractor/automobile sales, consumer durables sales, and rural inflation and wage growth indicate a softening of that economy. Analysts believe this trend will improve only at a gradual pace, leading to muted near-term performance by companies having a high exposure to this economy. Sectors such as agri chemicals, consumer goods, automobiles and banks/financial institutions will be more vulnerable to a weakening rural economy.Rakesh Arora, head of research at Macquarie Capital, says: \u201cWe are underweight on staples and positioned for a consumption slowdown in the rural economy. We believe slowing rural incomes will affect demand for building materials, two-wheelers and tractors. In this backdrop, we believe M&amp;M and Hero MotoCorp will be more impacted.\u201dAbout 67 per cent of M&amp;M's passenger vehicle sales and its entire tractor sales come from the rural segment. For two-wheeler companies, the rural economy contributes 40-50 per cent of sales volumes. In the consumer sector, HUL and Dabur derive about half their revenue from rural areas; this metric is about 45 per cent for Britannia. Thus, these companies will witness higher sales pressure than peers as the rural economy slows down. Interestingly, most consumer companies have invested in increasing their reach and revenues in rural areas over the past few years. This has led to higher sales contribution from these areas.&#13;\n\t&#13;\nThe volume growth estimates for FY16 can be misleading, given the low base of the preceding two years. Bajaj Auto and M&amp;M\u2019s utility vehicle portfolio saw volume contraction in FY14 and FY15. M&amp;M tractor sales volumes also fell in FY15.\u201cWe maintain our underweight-rural and preference for urban themes. Declining cash flows for the sector will have significant impact on rural themes, including consumer goods, automobiles, agri inputs and public sector banks,\u201d says Dhananjay Sinha, head of institutional equity at Emkay Global Financial Services.Agro chemicals and complex fertilisers will be hit the most by rural slowdown, though the impact on their financials will come in only with a lag effect. Falling commodity prices, though, provide some relief at the margin for these companies. \u201cOur preference remains for companies with asset-light and flexible business models such as Sharda Cropchem and Dhanuka Agritech or for companies with export exposure like UPL and PI Industries,\u201d adds Sinha of Emkay.As a large part of M&amp;M Financial and Shriram Transport's branches are in rural areas, these lenders will see impact on asset quality and credit offtake. Most banks will witness increased stress on their agricultural loans and will need to keep an eye on their asset quality. The possibility of debt waivers on agri loans could further impact this sector.", "newspaper": "Business Standard", "id": 53, "pubdate": "Thu, 09 Apr 2015 22:48:00 +0530", "title": "FY16 expected to see muted rural show"}, {"content": "&#13;\n         &#13;\n    &#13;\nAlthough Moody\u2019s Investor Service changed India\u2019s outlook to \u2018positive\u2019 from \u2018stable\u2019 on Thursday, the rating agency also highlighted concerns regarding India\u2019s banking sector\u2019s asset quality.&#13;\nAlthough Moody\u2019s Investor Service changed India\u2019s outlook to \u2018positive\u2019 from \u2018stable\u2019 on Thursday, the rating agency also highlighted concerns regarding India\u2019s banking sector\u2019s asset quality.While Moody\u2019s remains optimistic on the outlook for the economy and the government\u2019s reform process, it has warned that Indian banking system\u2019s asset quality, loan loss coverage and capital ratios are relatively weak.According to the rating agency, this poses sovereign credit risks due to the banking sector\u2019s role in financing growth and the government\u2019s deficits through its purchase of government securities, and the contingent liabilities owing to the government\u2019s ownership of a major portion of the banking sector.\u201cIn the absence of any improvement in banking system metrics over the coming months, India\u2019s sovereign credit profile will remain constrained,\u201d it says. However, Moody\u2019s believes the ability of policymakers to strengthen India\u2019s sovereign credit profile to a level consistent with a higher rating will only become apparent over the next 12-18 months.Despite Moody\u2019s flagging off concerns, banking stocks gained ground on Thursday with the Bank Nifty gaining 2.5 per cent to 18,876 levels.

However, they caution this will be a long-drawn process.Directionally, they suggest, things have started to improve for the banking sector, although the pace of improvement is a little slow. Banks\u2019 earnings in the fourth quarter of FY15 and the next two quarters of FY16 might not be good and the stressed assets should peak in the March 2015 quarter. By the end of FY16, the level of stressed assets in the system should be lower than in the previous year.\u201cIt is quite evident from the data the kind of stress there is in the banking system, primarily in the public sector banks (PSBs). But from a forward looking view, the government\u2019s reform process should start revising the core sectors like infrastructure, power, metals etc. So, the stress levels in these banks should start coming down from FY16 and FY17 onwards,\u201d said Vaibhav Agra-wal, vice-president (research - banking) at Angel Broking.\u201cIf we put together power, infrastructure and roads, they in total account for 60-70 per cent of the restructured assets. What\u2019s left, then, is textiles and chemical sectors that are export-oriented and have stress. As regards agriculture, there are well-defined systems in place that address issues like erratic monsoon or crop failure where banks need to deal with such accounts,\u201d he adds.Ankit Ladhani, an analyst tracking the sector with Karvy Stock Broking, also expects asset quality concerns for the banking sector to continue in the fourth of FY15 results as well. The performance of private banks, however, is expected to be better than that of PSBs, although they are also expected to report higher slippages and restructuring.

The focus, it says, is KRUCIAL - Kazakhstan, Russia, USA, China, Iran, Arab Republic of Egypt and Latin America.Exports have been slipping in recent years. From a high of 222 million kg in 2010, it dropped to 201 mn kg in 2014. The current year is not looking particularly good, too.India happens to be the fourth largest tea exporter in the world, after China, Sri Lanka and Kenya. Traditionally, our major export destinations have been Russia, UAE and Britain. Though production has been growing consistently at a compounded annual rate of three per cent, exports have been on a decline or, at best, flat. The main reason is an increase in domestic consumption, which has ensured firm prices.The unit price for exports during April 2014 to January 2015 was Rs 196.27 a kg, compared to Rs 202.60 a kg in the year-ago period. In contrast, during January-December 2014, prices at the Jakarta auction were down by Rs 14.75 a kg and Mombasa by Rs 18.03 a kg, though that at Colombo was higher by Rs 18.62 a kg.\"Firm prices have led to increasing competition from other producing countries, especially Kenya that has seen successive bumper crops,\" Monem said. Sri Lanka is also giving stiff competition.Tea production is in one of two styles, termed orthodox and non-orthodox; the latter is also commonly referred to as CTC (crush, tear, curl). Kenya is entirely a CTC producer; orthodox production accounts for almost the entire produce of Sri Lanka. In India, CTC accounts for around 90 per cent of output. Thus, Kenyan tea is in direct competition with Assam CTC, while Assam orthodox is pitted against Sri Lanka. Malawi, Mozambique and Uganda's tea are of the same quality as South Indian tea.India exports most of its orthodox production but only a small portion of CTC. Only 13 per cent of total North India (the term here refers to everything outside South India) production is exported. An ICRA report says most exports from North India are high-quality orthodox and CTC teas; South India exports medium to low quality teas that are used mainly as \"fillers\" in blending.Over the past decade, annual exports have stayed around 200 mn kg. The strategy for each of the markets the Tea Board plans to focus on would be different. For China, it would be taken up at the diplomatic level, as there are non-tariff barriers. China is predominantly a green tea market but is warming up to black tea. \"In Iran, there is a plan for joint promotion with packers. In Russia, the rupee-rouble mechanism needs to be worked on,\" Monem said.The industry is hoping that June-September, the time for exports, would see better weather and so, more production. So far, a dry spell has affected production.", "newspaper": "Business Standard", "id": 55, "pubdate": "Thu, 09 Apr 2015 22:34:00 +0530", "title": "Tea Board to try and push export"}, {"content": "&#13;\n         &#13;\n    &#13;\nThe Union government is to re-introduce the Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (Tufs), perhaps for at least 10 years, in the new textile policy, scheduled to be out by month-end.&#13;\nThe Union government is to re-introduce the Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (Tufs), perhaps for at least 10 years, in the new textile policy, scheduled to be out by month-end.In the revised policy, the onus of funding the sector is likely to be put on the states where factories exist. \u201cWe have increased states\u2019 share in central taxes to 42 per cent from 32 per cent earlier.

However, a final decision is yet to be taken,\u201d said Sanjay Kumar Panda, secretary, ministry of textiles, here on Thursday.Tufs, implemented from April 1999, was introduced to catalyse investments in the textile and jute industry, with a five per cent interest reimbursement. The scheme was initially approved from April 1999 to March 2004, extended to 2007 with modifications and further restructured with effect from April 2011, to March 2012.In 2012, then commerce minister Anand Sharma announced its continuation for the 12th Plan period of 2012-17, with an outlay of Rs 11,900 crore.

However, the survey sees demand improving and so prices, which could average to $1,170 in 2015 and $1,250 in the following year, the survey says.\u201cThe dollar is likely to retain currency supremacy, given monetary policy elsewhere in the world, and non-dollar-denominated gold prices are believed to have bottomed.\u201d In dollar terms, however, the GFMS team at Thomson Reuters, \u201cis looking for further slippage towards $1,100 per ounce during 2015, with an annual average of $1,170 per ounce in 2015, with prices rising towards year-end; this should lead to an average of $1,250 per ounce in 2016, as buying picks up in Asian markets and institutional investment in these markets offsets the recent decline in over-the-counter demand in the West.\u201dThe reasoning behind bottoming out of prices in local currencies is that a strengthening dollar would result in depreciation of other currencies and, hence, even if gold\u00a0 slips further in dollar terms, depreciation in other countries\u2019 local currency would not let the dollar price to fall much.Like most markets, gold also takes time to recover from periods of turbulence and, in early 2015, it is continuing the stabilisation of 2014 following the hurricane that swept through it in the previous year.For gold prices to go up, there is a need for fresh investment. Hence, the survey sees possibility of further shorts in gold.\u201cIndeed, there is still the possibility of short-side sales in response to any unsettling news or economic development. Once the new rate cycle is in place (or signalled), asset reallocation is likely to commence and we expect gold to benefit accordingly,\u201d the survey says.Official sector gold transactions in 2014 amounted to an estimated net purchase of 466 tonnes, up 14 per cent from 2013 and the second highest level since the end of the gold standard. The renewed eastward shift in physical gold demand (following the westward lurch following the start of the financial crisis) stalled last year, but is expected to resume as the markets continue to stabilise.A study conducted by StratWon Business Consulting for Platinum Guild International (PGI) showed the growth in platinum sales at 28 per cent in 2014. Sales by PGI\u2019s strategic retail partners were up by 33 per cent during 2014 while other outlets reported a growth of 19 per cent.\u201cGiven the overall market scenario, the platinum growth for 2014 has been very positive and consistent which comes from continuous improvement of consumer sentiment, higher conversion at the retail stores and improving the disposition for platinum among our key target audience. With the launch of Platinum Evara on the back of strong consumer research at the end of the year we are looking at further accelerating growth. The initial response to this new category has been very positive,\u201d said Vaishali Banerjee, country manager India, PGI.The jewellery fabrication business has increased six per cent in 2014 globally, except in China. The result of the massive surge in jewellery demand in China in 2013 was a fall of 35 per cent in Chinese jewellery consumption and 31 per cent in local jewellery fabrication last year. Even so, the Chinese jewellery fabrication in 2014 was seven per cent higher than in 2012 and the second highest on record. Heavy leasing activity in the local market has led to suggestions that retail demand was much higher than was actually the case.

Thanks to a sharp fall in commodity prices and currency turmoil, sales growth of Sensex 30 companies as well as India Inc is expected to contract sharply. While Crisil Research expects India Inc\u2019s revenue growth to slip to a seven-quarter low of 2.5 per cent, other research houses expect Sensex revenue growth to be flat to minus seven per cent. On the other hand, Sensex earnings growth is estimated in the range of -7.6 per cent to 5.6 per cent for the March quarter. In the December quarter, Sensex earnings had contracted five per cent.Worse, a dramatic moderation in profit growth of defensive sectors, which had propped the broader market in recent years. Over the past few weeks, analysts have downgraded earnings estimates of Sensex companies on more than one occasion. The result is a lack of consensus among equity strategists. Not many were expecting earnings\u2019 downgrades of so many sectors in a short span. This has made forecast of earnings growth a lot more difficult, leading to a divergence in estimates (see table). In fact, there is scope for further downgrades.Currently, even the most optimistic estimate suggests Sensex earnings growth by no more than six to nine per cent in FY15. Edelweiss says: \u201cGiven the poor earnings expectations, another two-three per cent downgrade in EPS (earnings per share) is likely.\u201dKotak Institutional Equities writes: \u201cVery few stocks offer any value on reasonable earnings assumptions. Some are terribly expensive and some face earnings downgrades from tenuous earnings assumptions.\u201dAmbit Capital\u2019s Nitin Bhasin writes, \u201cFollowing a disappointing third quarter and with signs of moderation across sectors, our analysts have downgraded their estimates for Q4 from three months ago for the majority of sectors. The more notable downgrades are in the automobile, consumer, cement, financials and E&amp;C (engineering &amp; construction) sectors.\u201dThe sharp drop in earnings of commodity-oriented sectors, oil &amp; gas and metals &amp; mining, are expected to dent the performance of cyclicals. While defensives matter from an earnings perspective, cyclicals account for 58 per cent of the benchmark\u2019s revenues. The big worry is the defensives (information technology or IT, pharmaceutical &amp; consumer goods). Their revenue growth is expected to almost halve to 10.7 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y), against the 20.2 per cent y-o-y rise in Q4 of FY14, says ICICI Securities.&#13;\n\t&#13;\nThe sharp pullback in government spending over the past two quarters, impact of deficient and unseasonal rain on rural India, and the dollar\u2019s strength against all other currencies have come together to hurt the earnings trajectory of corporate India.For IT companies, Q4 is historically weak. This one is expected to be worse, due to cross-currency headwinds. The dollar\u2019s strengthened by four to 10 per cent against most other major currencies, which would hurt the earnings of companies with a strong presence outside America. Sequential dollar revenue growth might remain flat or fall up to three per cent for many. Earnings growth, too, for most large IT companies is likely to be muted.Among other key sectors, metals might be the worst hit. While domestic steel demand is weak, a 60 per cent surge in Chinese imports is hurting business. Led by global cues, domestic prices are down eight to 10 per cent, impacting profit. Edelweiss estimates Tata Steel\u2019s net profit to fall by 95 per cent, while Kotak estimates a net loss of Rs 130 crore versus a consolidated profit of Rs 1,060 crore in Q4 of FY14. Profits of Jindal and JSW Steel are also seen falling sharply. Base metal companies Hindalco and Sesa Sterlite are expected to see a sharp decline in profit. The decline here of Tata Steel, Sesa Sterlite and Hindalco means their contribution to the Sensex profit after tax (PAT) will shrink from over five per cent last year to about one per cent in Q4.Engineering and capital goods companies will also see pressure on profits, particularly Bharat Heavy Electricals expected to be a drag for this sector. Positively, banking, financial services and insurance is expected to deliver healthy earnings growth. A big contributor to the Sensex PAT (13.5 per cent in the year-ago quarter), it has a strong influence on overall numbers. Earnings will be led by private sector banks Axis and HDFC, seen posting an 18-22 per cent rise in profit. Edelweiss analysts, led by Nilesh Parikh, say: \u201cIndustry credit growth, running at multi-year lows, will exert pressure on top-line growth of banks, especially public sector players facing capital and asset quality challenges, while private banks will continue to outpace industry growth.\u201dOil &amp; gas will also be a mixed bag but broadly positive. Oil marketing companies should deliver good operating performance, led by strong gross refining margins (GRMs). However, there is no clarity on net realisations. Among Sensex companies, strong GRMs mean Reliance Industries will deliver good performance. Estimates peg its profit at Rs 5,900-6,300 crore. Though oil prices are down (so, lower contribution on account of its stake in Cairn\u2019s oilfields), Oil &amp; Natural Gas Corporation should benefit on account of a lower subsidy burden.So, too, with automobiles. Two-wheelers have seen pressure on volumes, while passenger cars and commercial vehicles have fared better. The sector is expected to grow headline revenues in low single digits but net profit growth is expected to be about 10 per cent, led by better margins (lower input costs and currency gains).", "newspaper": "Business Standard", "id": 63, "pubdate": "Thu, 09 Apr 2015 22:14:00 +0530", "title": "Q4 earnings likely to be weakest in many quarters"}, {"content": "&#13;\n         &#13;\n    &#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n\tThe financial year 2015-16 is set to turn out to be a year for debt market reforms as experts believe there are many positive steps in the offing after the already announced measures. Though it is agreed that these reforms were long pending since many years, the street believes among the other measures Credit Default Swaps (CDS) could be relaunched, steps to enhance liquidity in corporate bonds may be announced and a full fledged screen based trading system for corporate bonds may be put in place.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tIn the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) first bi-monthly monetary policy earlier this week, the central bank said that they will formulate a scheme for market making by primary dealers in semi-liquid and illiquid government securities.&#13;\n&#13;\n\t\"A similar step could perhaps be taken by asking merchant bankers in corporate bonds by asking them to provide liquidity in bonds. That will add to substantial amount of liquidity in bonds. Today once the bonds gets sold in the market, these merchant bankers no longer provide liquidity to the market,\" said R Sivakumar, head of fixed income and products, Axis Mutual Fund.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tRBI also announced steps to boost retail participation in government securities. These measures include a web-based solution for all mid-segment and retail investors who have gilt accounts to participate in the government securities market and providing these investors direct access to both primary and secondary market platforms without any intermediary. For this, alternate channels of distribution of government securities would be created, RBI said.&#13;\n&#13;\n\t\"Retail participation in government securities will take a long time as fixed deposit rates are more attractive. There is scope for reforms in corporate bond market. For instance, it is critical to have a full fledged screen based trading system for bonds,\" said S Prabhu, head of fixed income at IDBI Federal Life Insurance.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tCurrently, secondary market activity in corporate bonds continues to be negligible when compared with the volumes in government securities. Besides that though CDS made its debut in 2011, but the instruments failed to take off. CDS are instruments where the buyers receives credit protection while the seller of the swap guarantees the credit worthiness of the debt security.&#13;\n&#13;\n\t\"The CDS market is needed because those who invest in corporate bonds, are exposed to interest rate risks as well as credit risks due to which there is a need for this instrument.

It describes this as a \"world class potential resource\" and that the well has the \"potential for significant daily oil production\".  Compared with similar geology in the US and West Siberia, it estimates that 3% to 15% of the oil could be recovered. Underground riches Oil has been produced onshore in the South of England for decades. There are currently around a dozen oil production sites across the Weald, a region spanning Kent, Sussex, Surrey and Hampshire.

Professor Alastair Fraser has used some of the most sophisticated equipment in the world, based at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, to analyse rock samples. His study of a third of the Weald came up with a resource of 13 billion barrels. \"So if I scaled that up, we are coming up to numbers of 40 billion barrels,\" he told the BBC. \"Now that's getting significant. That's a resource. That's what's there in the ground. We've still got to get it out.\"Fracking unnecessaryMost experts believe fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, will be needed to get commercial quantities of oil from the region. Concerns over fracking led to large-scale protests when Cuadrilla drilled at Balcombe, West Sussex, in 2013.But UKOG has consistently stated that it is not intending to use fracking, which involves pumping water, sand and chemicals into rocks at high pressure to liberate the oil and gas trapped within. It says that the oil at Horse Hill is held in rocks that are naturally fractured, which \"gives strong encouragement that these reservoirs can be successfully produced using conventional horizontal drilling and completion techniques\".The company says further drilling and well testing will be needed to prove these initial results.\n    ", "newspaper": "BBC", "id": 92, "pubdate": "Thu, 09 Apr 2015 11:42:46 +0530", "title": "Gatwick oil find 'significant'"}, {"content": "\n                        LinkedIn has about 300 million members who use the site's business networking tools\n                    \n                LinkedIn has bought US online learning business Lynda for $1.5bn (\u00a31.1bn), making it the professional networking site's biggest acquisition to date.LinkedIn is trying to boost the business content it offers to its 300 million users.Lynda, based in California, has made hundreds of videos that teach subscribers everything from coding to business skills.Subscribers pay $375 per year to access the tutorials.Although the company was founded nearly 20 years ago, it has expanded rapidly in the past two years, adding several languages to its video offerings and increasing outside investment.\"The mission of LinkedIn and the mission of lynda.com are highly aligned,\" said LinkedIn chief executive Jeff Weiner in a statement. \"Both companies seek to help professionals be better at what they do.\" Shares in LinkedIn rose more than 1.5% on the New York Stock Exchange after news of the acquisition was released.\n    ", "newspaper": "BBC", "id": 93, "pubdate": "Fri, 10 Apr 2015 03:30:35 +0530", "title": "LinkedIn buys learning firm for $1.5bn"}, {"content": "The eurozone has said only six working days are left for Greece to come up with a revised list of reforms to seal a deal on its next rescue bailout.Eurozone deputy finance ministers want an agreement on the \u20ac7.2bn loan in time for a Eurogroup meeting on 24 April.An EU official said: \"If you take into account weekends and Orthodox Easter, there are only six days left.\"It comes as Greece said it had met Thursday's deadline to repay \u20ac460m to the International Monetary Fund.A Greek government official told the Reuters news agency: \"The payment has been made.\"Financial helpOther, much larger, debt repayments are due within a few weeks.Analysis: Chris Morris, BBC News, AthensGreece has fulfilled its financial commitments today, but the situation is becoming rather desperate.

The researchers say it has advantages over lithium-ion batteries, common in electronic devices like smartphones, as well as traditional alkaline batteries.Other scientists have said the work is exciting but still at a very early stage.\"We have developed a rechargeable aluminium battery that may replace existing storage devices, such as alkaline batteries, which are bad for the environment, and lithium-ion batteries, which occasionally burst into flames,\" said senior author Prof Hongjie Dai from Stanford University in California.\"Our new battery won't catch fire, even if you drill through it.\" In fact, a video made by the research team shows that the battery even continues to work for a short period after being punished in this way. We may not expect batteries to withstand such treatment routinely - but this demonstration certainly sets the new design apart from lithium-ion batteries, which have faced safety concerns including recent bans on air transport.Because it is lightweight and inexpensive, aluminium has attracted interest from battery engineers for many years, but it has never yielded a viable product.Key to the new discovery was the choice of material for the other, positive electrode (the cathode) to go with aluminium for the negative electrode (or anode). Graphite - a form of carbon in which the atoms form thin, flat sheets - turned out to deliver very good performance, while also being similarly lightweight, cheap and widely available.\n                        The cathode looks like a graphite sponge, pictured here using a microscope (white line is 1cm in the inset, 0.3mm in the main image)\n                    \n                To connect the two electrodes, the pouch is filled with liquid. \"The electrolyte is basically a salt that's liquid at room temperature, so it's very safe,\" said PhD student Ming Gong, another of the study's authors. This contrasts with the flammable electrolytes used in lithium-ion batteries. \nI think it's very exciting and it gives new pointers as to how one might get that type of chemistry to workProf Clare Grey, University of Cambridge\n'Early days'The battery performed particularly well when the team made the graphite cathode into a foam: a sponge-like pattern of tiny whiskers of the stuff, surrounding many empty pockets. This allows ions in the electrolyte solution very easy access to the graphite, helping the battery to work faster.When the battery discharges, aluminium dissolves at the anode, while aluminium-containing ions slide into the spaces between atomic graphite layers at the cathode. When it charges again, the reverse occurs, depositing metallic aluminium metal back on the anode.Crucially, this can take place through more than 7,500 complete cycles without the battery losing any capacity - several times more than most lithium-ion batteries, and hundreds of times better than any previous experimental designs that used aluminium.Similarly, the device's two-volt output is the best seen from an aluminium battery. It is also better than common 1.5-volt alkaline batteries, but lags behind the output of the lithium-ion batteries we use in smartphones and laptops.\n                        Lithium batteries are commonly used but have faced safety concerns\n                    \n                \"Our battery produces about half the voltage of a typical lithium battery,\" Prof Dai said. \"But improving the cathode material could eventually increase the voltage and energy density.\"Nonetheless, his team has high hopes for their design. Already, just by strapping two of the pouch batteries together and plugging them into an adaptor, they managed to charge up a smartphone in a minute. They also suggest it could be very useful in flexible displays, one of the proposals for the next generation of electronics.Prof Dai clearly believes its voltage is the battery's single main limitation: \"Our battery has everything else you'd dream that a battery should have: inexpensive electrodes, good safety, high-speed charging, flexibility and long cycle life.\"I see this as a new battery in its early days. It's quite exciting.\"Problem of scaleClare Grey, a materials chemist at the University of Cambridge, said the work was \"definitely a step-change\" for aluminium batteries.\"Aluminium batteries are very difficult technology and I think their method of storing the charges inside the graphite is rather clever,\" Prof Grey told BBC News.But she added that turning the prototype into a larger commercial product would be challenging. One problem is that the process of squeezing ions in between the graphite sheets can cause the material to expand and contract, which is \"bad news for the battery\", Prof Grey explained.\"And then also, the bigger the graphite sheets are, the further the ions have got to diffuse in - so the slower it gets. So part of reason it's got this high rate is that it's got very small platelets of graphite.\"She was impressed by the concept and the demonstration of the new design, however.\"I think it's very exciting and it gives new pointers as to how one might get that type of chemistry to work,\" Prof Grey said.Follow Jonathan on Twitter\n    ", "newspaper": "BBC", "id": 102, "pubdate": "Tue, 07 Apr 2015 22:13:14 +0530", "title": "Bendy battery promises safety, speed"}, {"content": "\n                        Every little helps: Tesco requested compensation for the milk\n                    \n                Supermarket giant Tesco has won \u00a31.50 compensation from a customer who spilt a bottle of milk in one of its stores.Shopper Cornelius Price, 40, threw the six-pint bottle in a temper, Llandrindod Wells Magistrates' Court heard.It was claimed he was verbally abusive and escorted off the premises.Admitting criminal damage, Price said he threw the milk towards the store manager saying \"catch it\" but it accidentally spilt.\"He was told to return the milk he was holding and leave the store and he threw it at the floor in temper,\" said Julie Sullivan, prosecuting.\"\u00a31.50 compensation is requested for the milk.\"Phil Sherrard, defending, said: \"This is minor criminal damage.

They have to pay for their rent, for the children's clothes. But still, we fight on. We have belief.\" Weaker oil pricesBut with talk now of a combined Iraqi-Kurdish operation to liberate Iraq's second city, Mosul, it is an open question whether belief alone can bring victory. Indeed, a financial crisis has been brewing for several months. The halving of the global oil price - undercutting Kurdistan's main source of revenue - and the effect of the war have both had a deleterious effect, especially after fighting in August saw the black flags of Islamic State (IS) come just 19 miles (30km) from Erbil, the capital of the Kurdish autonomous region in northern Iraq.\"When IS is at the door, logically it's hard to convince foreign investors that Erbil's safe and nothing's wrong,\" says Govan Haji Akravi, chief executive of Fastnet, an internet systems provider for foreign companies in the city. \"Almost from one day to another, many of them packed up and left.\" \n                        Some Kurdish fighters have not been paid for three months, says their commander, Faridon Jwanroyi\n                    \n                \n                        Islamic State fighters came within 19 miles (30km) of the regional capital Erbil last summer\n                    \n                Displaced peopleThere's also been a major refugee crisis. Some one-and-a-half million displaced people have arrived in Kurdistan, fleeing the fighting in Syria and northern Iraq. That's a 30% increase in the population of the region, leading to huge extra stresses, I'm told, on local services like water and education. The refugees are mostly housed in improvised camps. One of the more bizarre is the Ankawa Mall - a half-built shopping centre on the outskirts of Erbil. Like many building projects, it was abandoned by its developer as the crisis hit last year. Now the raw concrete shell is occupied by some 4,000 Iraqi Christians from the Mosul region, sleeping in alcoves created for designer boutiques. A makeshift wickerwork crucifix hangs over the entrance. One of the refugees, Issa, charges about 30 cents for a haircut and shave in his makeshift barber's shop in the main atrium at the foot of two massive escalators that are now derailed and disintegrating. \"I'm cheaper than the Kurdish barbers here,\" he tells me. \"No one wants to look hairy like the guys from Islamic State, so they come to me!\" he laughs.

For the last year, Baghdad has only fitfully been paying the regional government in Erbil its share of the national budget. Under the constitution, Baghdad requires the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) to share its own oil production with the rest of the country. The Kurds should then be reimbursed with 17% of the total nationwide budget, which is currently set at $105bn (\u00a371bn).  Baghdad has accused Erbil of selling oil illegally, without its authority, and of failing to meet production quotas - allegations the Kurds deny. \"Baghdad knows very well we are selling oil - we have to pay people's salaries,\" says Dr Ali Sindi, the KRG's minister of planning. \"Meanwhile five million Iraqi citizens have been cut off from their rightful share of the nation's resources. This is a threat to the stability and the sustainability of the region,\" he says.The anger in Kurdistan is all the greater since Baghdad is continuing to pay salaries to government workers living under Islamic State. Even some refugees - civil servants displaced from Mosul - are, it is said, receiving their salaries from within the camps, whilst some of those caring for them haven't been paid since December.In the last three weeks, Baghdad has announced a breakthrough, saying it is renewing budget payments, although so far these amount to less than half what is owed for just March alone. Salaries for most workers, including soldiers, remain many months in arrears. The Iraqi Prime Minister, Haider Al-Abadi, has been quoted as blaming delays on a wider economic crisis in Baghdad. \n                        Under Iraq's constitution, the Kurds have to share their own oil output with the rest of the country\n                    \n                \n                        Kurdistan should be getting $105bn (\u00a371bn) from the central government in Baghdad\n                    \n                'We don't give up'\"If we don't reach a lasting solution, we will have to handle it through our own export of oil,\" says Dr Sindi. Kurdistan is this month said to be completing a new pipeline to its northern neighbour, Turkey. But despite the threats, few in Erbil believe Kurdistan has the political power to cut its own deals with the wider world.  In the meantime, some state employees are getting desperate. Civil servant Najad Amin and his wife Iqbal say they expect the last of their savings to run out in the next month. They've started growing vegetables in their back garden, to help feed the family. Do they blame the politicians in Baghdad or in Erbil, I ask?\"They're all to blame,\" they say. \"But we Kurds are used to depending on ourselves. We will find a way.

But cybercrime on the continent has moved far beyond this, with gangs embracing more sophisticated ways to use technology, such as malware and botnets, to get what they want.Internet usage is rising rapidly in Africa, and with it, cybercrime.This growth is making it easier than ever for criminals to operate. And it has created a new pool of potential victims lacking the knowledge and experience to be able to protect themselves effectively.VictimsSecurity expert Kaspersky says more than 49 million cyber-attacks took place on the continent in the first quarter of last year, with most occurring in Algeria, ahead of Egypt, South Africa and Kenya.But cybercrime is actually most pervasive in South Africa, with security firm Norton saying 70% of South Africans have fallen victim to cybercrime, compared with 50% globally.McAfee, another cybersecurity firm, reported that cybercrime cost South African companies more than $500m (\u00a3340m) last year.\n                        In South Africa 70% of people have been victims of cybercrime, says Norton\n                    \n                Baby stepsAfrica has long lacked a legal framework for tackling cybercrime.But in June 2014, the African Union (AU) approved a convention on cybersecurity and data protection that could see many countries enact personal protection laws for the first time.For it to be implemented, however, 15 of the 54 AU member states will need to ratify the text. As yet, not one country has done so, though there is optimism it will happen in the next three-to-five years. \"Cybersecurity is a growing concern for the nations of the African Union as more people come online,\" says Drew Mitnick, junior policy counsel at human rights organisation Access, which has called on member states to ratify the convention as soon as possible.\"It is critical for the countries to adopt cybersecurity policies that better protect users while respecting their privacy and other human rights.\" \n                        The African Union (AU) is made up of 54 member states - only Morocco doesn't belong\n                    \n                Access believes the AU should lead these efforts. The group has tracked proposed cyber and data protection laws in Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritania, Morocco, Tanzania, Tunisia and Uganda. In each case, the legislation would either fail to provide basic protection for user data, or allow the government to violate the rights of privacy, expression, and assembly, Access believes.But Beza Belayneh, managing director of the African Cyber Risk Institute (ACRI), says there are positives.\"[The convention] is a jumpstart for many countries who do not have any legal ground or appreciation to combat cybercrime,\" he says.\"It is a good guide to develop... computer or cybersecurity laws in a localised manner. It is the best way just to start the job. It has to start somewhere.\"It is apparent that many, if not all, African countries lack the capabilities to defend their ever-growing cyber infrastructure.\"Cybersecurity is finally receiving the attention it deserves, he added.Ducks in a rowAs a guide to helping African nations get their \"cyber ducks in order\", as Mr Belayneh puts it, the AU convention isn't too bad. Mr Mitnick says the convention contains a data protection provision covering control of personal data, with a large part of it mirroring the data protection framework and language developed by the European Union.He also commends the protection of human rights. \"The text requires governments to uphold the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, along with other basic rights such as \"freedom of expression, the right to privacy, and the right to a fair hearing, among others,\" he says.\"The inclusion of privacy is most welcome, considering it is not explicitly found in the African Charter.\"\n                        The AU proposals include giving judges unlimited power to issue search and seizure warrants on data or computers - causing understandable concern about human rights\n                    \n                'Negative effects'However, there are real concerns about some of the provisions. The Centre for Intellectual Property and Information Technology Law at Strathmore University, Kenya, is against implementation in its current form.It believes the convention could limit freedom of expression and allow authorities to intercept private data too easily. Judges would be given unlimited power to issue search and seizure warrants on data or computers, for example.All this could have \"substantial negative effects on online economies and social cultures across Africa,\" it says.\n                        A woman uses a tablet at an internet cafe in Dakar, Senegal\n                    \n                Mr Belayneh agrees that the document gives too much power to judges and law enforcement arms of governments, and says it fails to take into account the roles of education and consultation in combating cybercrime.\"It was written by lawyers,\" he says. \"Cybersecurity and cybercrime need a multi-sectoral approach - cybersecurity educators, researchers, NGOs [non-governmental organisations], vendors, ethical hackers were supposed to be involved so they could present a multi-dimensional framework instead of legal paper.\"\n                        Does criminalising \"insulting language\" allow governments to clamp down on dissent?\n                    \n                Some of the convention's phrases seem to be in direct conflict with protecting human rights. For instance, while the convention limits the processing of personal data, it contains an exception for a task \"carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority\" - a loophole ripe for abuse, some experts believe.Mr Mitnick says the convention could also pave the way for harsh criminal convictions. \"In one example, it limits the use of insulting language, which could describe a significant portion of the language on the internet and is likely to lead to subjective prosecutions,\" he says.Though the experts believe the convention is satisfactory as a first step, the negatives are certainly clear for all to see. \n    ", "newspaper": "BBC", "id": 113, "pubdate": "Fri, 10 Apr 2015 04:48:55 +0530", "title": "Cybersecurity v human rights in Africa"}, {"content": "Hairdresser Ep Weatherhead has a business that is going places.The owner of the first mobile barber's shop in Australia, from Tuesdays to Saturdays she parks her converted van at different locations across Sydney's beachside suburb of Maroubra.Together with one part-time member of staff, she cuts the hair of 40 men and boys on an average day.The business - called The Barber Van - was set up in 2011 with 60,000 Australian dollars ($46,000; \u00a331,000) of investment.

A domicile is usually the country his or her father considered his permanent home when he or she was born, or it may be the place overseas where somebody has moved to with no intention of returning.That means somebody can be born, be educated and work in the UK but still hold non-dom status. It also means that some may inherit their non-dom status from their parents.For proof to the tax authority, they have to provide evidence about their background, lifestyle and future intentions, such as where they own property or intend to be buried.Key to non-dom tax status is that an individual must pay UK tax on UK earnings, but need not pay UK tax on foreign income or gains unless they bring that income back to the UK.Has this system been around for a while?Yes, for more than 200 years.The FT says it was originally introduced in 1799 and allowed people with foreign property to shelter it from wartime taxes.It became a regular point of debate during and after the financial crisis when the legal tax affairs of wealthy residents was put under the spotlight.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPolicy guide: Taxation\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tThis election issue includes income tax and national insurance levies and business taxes.\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\tHow many non-doms are there?This is where things become a little more opaque.People do not necessarily have to indicate their domicile status on their UK tax return. The UK tax authority believes there was a general trend of rising numbers to 2008 when charges came in, but a fall since.There were an estimated 114,800 non-doms in 2012-13, according to the latest figures available.Non-doms have included some super-wealthy household names, but also include some foreign doctors and nurses working for the NHS, as well as some students.What tax charges do non-doms face?Non-doms who have lived in the UK for seven of the last nine years must pay \u00a330,000 each year to maintain their tax status.Those living in the UK for 12 of the last 14 years must pay \u00a350,000 to do so.Non-doms living in the UK for 17 of the last 20 years must pay \u00a390,000 to keep their non-dom status.About 5,000 people pay these charges, raising an estimated \u00a3300m this year for the Treasury.Some other countries have similar regimes, but the seven-year period of grace is unusual internationally.What would scrapping non-dom status mean?There would still be a period of time where temporary workers and students can legally maintain their domicile overseas.However, the big questions raised by effectively scrapping non-dom status include:Whether there will be a flight of non-doms who paid an estimated \u00a36.2bn in UK tax in 2012-13\nHow much can be raised in UK taxes if former non-doms decide to stay?\nWill that tax income outstrip the amount raised from non-dom charges? Labour says it would do so by several hundred million pounds but this is very difficult to quantify\nWhat will be the effect on jobs and business creation in the UK?\nWhether this will create a more even playing field among entrepreneurs irrespective of their domicile\nThe debate is likely to continue whichever party wins the election.", "newspaper": "BBC", "id": 115, "pubdate": "Wed, 08 Apr 2015 18:42:52 +0530", "title": "Q&A: What is a non-dom?"}, {"content": "US art museums took a knock in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and attendances continue to fall. But some major investments and new approaches to fundraising have helped them rebound. On an unseasonably warm day in January, as the price of oil dropped by 50%, a group of Texans gathered at a swanky New York restaurant to present a multi-million dollar plan for the redevelopment of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston.There were a number of jokes about the impact of oil prices on the portion sizes offered by the restaurant - two salad leaves and a pea, however artfully placed on a teaspoon of green mousse and a coin sized piece of fish, do not make a meal in Texas.But there was no joking about the importance of art to Houston's economy, which is fuelled by oil and energy and has been rocked by the plunge in prices.The city hopes the new campus, with its world class collections, international art school and conservation centre, will help attract the type of workers it needs to diversify and sustain future growth.\"Building a green park of two acres in a downtown city - that's meaningless today,\" says Texan pipeline tycoon Rich Kinder, one of the richest men in America with a personal net worth estimated at $11.9bn (\u00a38bn).\"This is a massive extension of the south west's largest museum of fine arts, but it's also much more than that. It's transformational for Houston.\" US Art FundingIndividual philanthropy remains the strongest source of support for art museums in the US. In 2013 museums were given six times as many works of art as they purchased.Endowments, trusts and foundations provide 28% of art museum funding.  The government funds 6% and corporate giving accounts for just 4%.Visitors spend an average of $8 when they go to a museum.Each visitor costs the museum an average of $53 in terms of investment.Figures from the Association of Art Museum DirectorsAlmost all the $350m cost of the project has been met by wealthy individuals, including Mr Kinder, who is chairman of the museum's board of trustees. He donated $50m. Due to be completed by 2019, the museum campus is expected to generate $334m in economic activity over 20 years. That's in line with a new report from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), a government grant-making agency, which says arts and culture contribute almost $700bn to the US economy, outperforming the construction industry. The sector also employs some 4.7 million workers, and for every 100 jobs created by demand for the arts, 62 jobs are created in other areas.On the downside, the report also shows that museum, gallery and theatre attendances are continuing to fall. According to the NEA, the vast majority of Americans \"consume\" the arts online and only 21% actually visit art museums.  \"But we do ourselves a disservice when we look at only one measure of engagement with the arts,\" says NEA chairman Jane Chu. \"Our reports show that the arts are a formidable presence in America and the ways in which people participate are expanding.\"\n                        Baltimore Museum of Art uses special events to encourage children to visit\n                    \n                She says technology provides an early entry point to the arts which may peak interest in live performances and trips to museums. But institutions need to find new ways to engage with audiences and become more relevant to their communities, she adds.\"Museums were founded years ago on the idea that they were treasure troves or libraries of objects. Today they have to be destinations for people to have experiences that they can create and be a part of,\" says Doreen Bolger, director of the Baltimore Museum of Art in Maryland.The museum has an international reputation and holds the largest collection of works by Henri Matisse. It is supported by a $100m endowment that enables it to offer art making days for local families, outreach programs for city schools, and interactive mobile phone tours for visitors. In 2006 it introduced free admission.'Financially stable'\"We were of course affected by the 2008 downturn because all of our diverse [revenue] sources were affected. But our trustees and donors have been truly astounding. \"Our funding from them was sustained throughout the downturn and many people increased their giving when the museum went free. They felt it was important to provide that for the community,\" says Ms Bolger.Endowments remain the most significant source of museum revenue, but new figures from the Association of Art Museum Directors (AAMD) show that funding has become more diversified.Admission fees play a relatively small part, but memberships, foundations and trusts, store purchases and local government funding make important contributions. Corporate donations have fallen.\"Museum attendance dropped off in 2008 and some museums underwent some staffing cuts, cut back a little on programming. They did what they needed to do to weather the storm,\" says AAMD director Christine Anagnos.\"But they're [now] financially stable because they receive their money from a variety of sources,\" she says.\"They're not just relying on one source, whether it's endowment income or earned revenue or corporate memberships. They are really diversified in their revenue streams.\"Oil dependenceIronically, Houston was sheltered from the worst effects of the financial crisis because of its dependence of oil. But today that dependence is making it vulnerable.\n                        Baltimore Museum of Art says community relevance is vital for survival.\n                    \n                \"People will tell you that Houston is not nearly as wedded to energy as it was a generation ago,\" says Rich Kinder.\"We have the largest medical centre in the world, a tremendous port and a number of universities. But [the falling price of oil] still has a definite impact and will have an impact on philanthropic giving.\"But Gary Tinterow, the director of Houston's Museum of Fine Arts, says he doesn't expect any dramatic decline in donations, and philanthropy remains a better bet than public funding.\"There is something very satisfying and secure when you have government support. You know what your budget is each year and you move forward. But as we've seen with the recent downturn, sometimes massive cuts are necessary in order to fill the mandates from the government.\"The Obama administration has proposed a $2m increase to funding for the NEA next year, bringing the total to $148m. The advocacy group Americans for the Arts says that won't meet the needs of the 95,000 non-profit arts organisations and local agencies the NEA helps support.But the good news is that donations to the arts were up by almost 8% in 2013, according to the latest figures from Indiana University, which tracks charitable giving. The total, $16.66bn, is now touching pre-recession levels.Even if Americans don't go to museums as much as they used to, they clearly think the arts are important enough to support.\n    ", "newspaper": "BBC", "id": 116, "pubdate": "Wed, 08 Apr 2015 05:05:22 +0530", "title": "Funding an art renaissance in the US"}, {"content": "\n                        Chile is the top-performing Latin American country in both OECD and Unesco school tests\n                    \n                There have been concerns that the quality of education has been stagnant in too many countries across Latin America.This is a major problem in a globalised economy, where rewards go to the most highly-skilled and most productive workers, and where there is more importance than ever attached to high-quality education.But how do we measure the quality of education in Latin America against global standards if there is an unwillingness to take part in international tests? How can would-be reformers compare results across international borders?Among the most widely recognised international comparisons are the Pisa tests - the Programme for International Student Assessment - conducted every three years by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).In Latin America, the regional rankings of these international tests taken by 15 year olds in maths, reading and science, are headed by diminutive Chile, ahead of economic powerhouses like Brazil and Mexico.But most countries remain off the ranking completely.Missing the testsPart of the reluctance for many Latin American countries might be a fear of being compared with world leaders in education like Finland and Japan. Even Chile, the highest ranking country in the region, is considerably below the global average for these tests, with the average in the Pisa tests being countries such as the UK and France.Latin America: Countries in Pisa testsChile\n51st (out of 65 countries and regional education systems)\nMexico\n53rd\nUruguay\n55th\nCosta Rica\n56th\nBrazil\n58th\nArgentina\n59th\nColombia\n62nd\nPeru\n65th\nSource: OECD\n\nBut the Pisa exam has also generated significant controversy over its methodology and design, leading to concerns - common to many standardised tests - that it does not adequately measure the quality of instruction. Or that it does not truly capture the diversity of contexts facing such different school systems.These concerns are reflected in the fact that fewer than half of Latin American countries currently participate.But there are other tests that can provide a global scale for measurement. Unesco's Third Regional Comparative and Explanatory Study (TERCE) covers a much larger part of the region. This has evaluated 15 countries, including Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, and Colombia, as well as smaller participants such as Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala, the Dominican Republic and Uruguay. \n                        Unesco's tests measure pupils in countries such as Guatemala against international standards\n                    \n                The assessment also has a broader range than Pisa, looking at children at different stages of development (at the ages of eight and 11), and evaluating the context of each school.What TERCE found was reason for cautious optimism - but also renewed effort. Its comparison between its last evaluation in 2006 and today showed a modest but broad improvement in test results across the majority of Latin American countries. These rankings were also headed by Chile, followed by Costa Rica and Uruguay. But they also allowed a comparison with countries missing from the Pisa tests, such as Guatemala and Paraguay, which appear in the lower half of the TERCE test scores.Falling behindBut despite - or even because of - the surrounding controversy, these tests have already served an important purpose. Whatever their flaws, they have brought attention to the fact that the massive expansion of access to education in the region, a major victory in itself, isn't sufficient without an equal improvement in quality. \n                        Uphill struggle: Peru is at the bottom of the Pisa rankings, but midway on the Unesco scale\n                    \n                No longer can policymakers ignore the reality that even Latin America's best performing countries, much less its average ones, are far behind the developed world, and far behind where they need to be to compete in the global economy. A student from Honduras or Paraguay is competing for jobs with graduates in Singapore and South Korea.

Latin America's education systems spend nearly as much as the OECD average, with some spending as much as 6% of GDP, while producing lacklustre results.More funding is in some cases necessary, but without a rigorous and targeted approach to ensure that it is spent well, the extra money may just be wasted.That's why a new conversation is needed in Latin America, one that focuses on innovative ways to improve quality - and quickly.A wave of new participants - social entrepreneurs, private businesses, investment funds, foundations, and advocacy groups - are taking the lead in introducing new pedagogies, new technologies, and structural reforms in their education systems.And projects like Pisa and TERCE are helping to put these issues front and centre on the public policy agenda.The next generation of students has little time to lose.

Most are tourists looking up in awe at the LED screens that dominate the landscape.  Nobody notices the tiny dark figure 350 feet above the pavement clinging to the side of the century old Times Building, home of the New Year's Eve Ball.Jeff Rolfe is a cross between Spider Man and Guy Fawkes, gingerly making his way up and down the side of the building with a bitter winter wind attacking him from every angle as he dangles. In his arms are pre-configured wooden racks full of small explosives. He has to install enough to put smiles on a billion TV viewers worldwide. Thankfully these are the finishing touches to a display of fireworks that in just over 24 hours will hopefully also elicit oohs and aahs from a million New Years Eve revellers in the Square. \n                        Jeff Rolfe on top of One Times Square\n                    \n                Short but sweetFor almost everyone the thrill of fireworks is an experience that can be traced back to childhood. Yet if you were able to time travel backwards two, three or four decades into history and stand once again in front of your local town display, you would likely be  disappointed. Mr Rolfe, from Fireworks By Santore, says few people realise that fountains, rockets, wheels and bursts have all taken a huge step forward thanks to technology.\"The shows used to be much much longer, over an hour in duration. But attention spans are shorter now,\" he says.\"Today, 30 minutes is considered a very long display. Technicians used to manually shoot big shells from steel tube mortars that would need to cool down before the next ones could be fired. It was more relaxed. Now we shoot multiple smaller shells per second from several locations, remotely.\"\n                        Fireworks are something most of us learn to love as children. This group is celebrating July 4th in 1940 with sparklers\n                    \n                \n                        The fireworks at the closing ceremony of the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984 might leave modern audiences slightly underwhelmed\n                    \n                Songs were played in their entirety rather than the mixed snippets that are favoured today. And any notion of syncing the beats to the bursts was usually a happy accident rather than anything pre-planned.New software and hardware means shells and cannons can be fired remotely up to two miles away and timed to within 1/100th of a second. And in a world full of giant LEDs, laser beams and light shows, fireworks are frequently asked to become team players, which is why \"syncing\" is one of the most sought after skills in the industry.\"Using computer software, we mark where we want the highs and lows of the display to be in relation to the music,\" says Mr Rolfe. \"And then we backtrack all the timings, and create digital cues alongside the music track for the firing sequence in an FSK (Frequency Shift Keying) file. When you hear it, it sounds like the noise made by an old modem.\"\n                        The fireworks business has always been dangerous - these men are making fireworks by hand for King George V's coronation celebrations in 1911\n                    \n                \n                        Health and safety has come a long way since 1929, when these women were pictured in France\n                    \n                Like clockworkBig events, especially those on live TV are usually produced using \"timecode\".  A highly accurate digital clock signal is generated from a central source and every person, computer, device and camera at the event uses it as their only time reference. Music tracks, lighting and fireworks can be pre-programmed digitally to flow together perfectly.But it can take months of work by specialist designers to produce a dazzling display. One thing on their side is that the chemical compounds have become more sophisticated.  The colours are brighter, the variety of effects has greatly increased and there is far less residual smoke that once might have blocked subsequent bursts.\n                        Fireworks have become ubiquitous at sporting events - here during the opening ceremony for the 2015 Cricket World Cup in New Zealand\n                    \n                Fireworks today are so chemically precise and stable, a horizontal rocket with a label that says 60 feet will shoot off a building straight out exactly 60 feet, and predictably reach its peak explosion right at the end of that distance without letting gravity pull it down prematurely. Of course timecode and technology are not always perfect, and when things go wrong the motto invented for the digital age - \"all or nothing\" definitely applies. Perhaps the most famous incident was the 2012 Big Bay Boom display in San Diego, which saw about 18 minutes worth of fireworks explode in just 15 seconds thanks to a timecode issue. It could have been the most expensive fireworks display ever (on a per second basis). But firework displays that often cost cities as much as a teacher's annual salary have an upside - successful or not.Officials in San Diego worked out their firework display fiasco still generated about $10m in revenue from local restaurants, tourism, boat hires, and hotel stays. And accidents don't happen as much these days. The biggest problem with older displays was explosions due to sparks from other fireworks in the display. Now the devices are smaller and more spread out so it doesn't happen as often.\n                        Accidents at modern events are now rare - this traditional display however is created by throwing molten metal against a cold wall in Nuanquan, Hebei province, China to celebrate the Spring Festival\n                    \n                Corporate communicationsCorporate requests often drive the direction of the fireworks industry. Companies are increasingly asking for daytime fireworks which have been around for years, but now look much better because once again there are brighter colours and cleverer chemical combinations which make them more dramatic against a bright blue backdrop.\n                        Flogos are created using a portable bubble container, and allow you to create airborne company logos\n                    \n                Despite the many developments one request that is harder than you'd think is to reproduce corporate logos. Mr Rolfe acknowledges that static logos are easy to do. But firing words and exact shapes from the ground into the sky with 100% accuracy for the entire audience to read from different vantage points is an art form that's in its infancy. \"We are just starting to work with it. The new firing systems allow us to shoot from the same location over and over again to basically form line art. It's not a cheap effect. It takes a bit of trial and error to get the sizing right but when it's done right it's pretty incredible.\"Other companies offer a variation of ways to reproduce airborne corporate designs closer to the ground, such as Flogos, which are made in a portable bubble container and sent off into the sky at a rapid pace.\n                        The view from the top: This is the angle the public doesn't see\n                    \n                \n                        The preparations go on, far above the heads of revellers\n                    \n                But Mr Rolfe believes the future of fireworks is solid. Despite the rising costs of insurance, security, transportation and storage he thinks that beautiful explosions in the sky will never be trumped by holograms or video screens or anything else.Everyone over five loves sparks and sparkle.\n    ", "newspaper": "BBC", "id": 118, "pubdate": "Tue, 07 Apr 2015 04:32:24 +0530", "title": "Technology to take fireworks nuclear"}, {"content": "\n                        Jorge Paulo Lemann is head of 3G Capital\n                    \n                Brazil's richest man Jorge Paulo Lemann does not eat burgers. A former tennis player, who competed in Wimbledon in the 1960s, he is an advocate of healthy eating.But when it comes to business it appears he has a rather different appetite, one that stretches to ready meals and processed foods.His company 3G Capital - which already owned Heinz and Burger King - bought the US food giant Kraft last month, in partnership with billionaire investor Warren Buffett.\nTheir firms have discipline, high productivity and low waste - qualities many companies in Brazil are still lacking today\nThe products may have a tendency to stretch your waistline, but Lemann, who was born in Rio de Janeiro, is obsessed with lean companies.In late 2008, barely months after acquiring Anheuser-Busch, makers of Budweiser beer, Lemann and his associates overhauled the company, shedding 1,400 jobs, some 6% of its workforce.In one year, 3G Capital found $10bn in savings and divestments.Executives lost all sorts of privileges: walls were torn down and personal offices were joined together in open plan spaces. The number of company Blackberries issued to employees fell from 1,200 to 720.Freebies like free baseball tickets, free beer or first-class tickets were cut. Private jets belonging to Anheuser-Busch were sold.\"They take cost-cutting very seriously,\" says Cristiane Correa, a journalist and author of Dream Big, a book on the rise of Lemann and his two fellow countrymen and partners Marcel Telles and Beto Sicupira.\"Some people get really scared by that. Afterwards, of course, the company grows and they end up hiring again, but at start it is ugly.\"Desire to get richCost-cutting is one of 3G Capital's obsessions. But there are others too, such as meritocracy and investing in the right people.Some of 3G Capital's top executives that today are in charge of leading global brands have been with Lemann since the early days of Garantia - the bank he founded in the 1970s.Back then, the magnate had already coined the term PSD to describes his ideal employees: \"Poor, Smart, with a Deep Desire to Get Rich.\" Marcel Telles, one of 3G's three strongmen and with a net fortune estimated upwards of $13bn, started out his career as a sort of office boy in Garantia.One trait that is conspicuously absent in 3G Capital's business model is innovation.\n                        3G Capital owns Burger King\n                    \n                The company makes its fortunes by finding optimum ways of producing something simple - like a burger or ketchup - and repeating that formula on a larger scale, without requiring much creativity.\"This model is well-suited to the food industry, where you can make a lot of money if you are disciplined enough to avoid waste when producing,\" says Leni Hidalgo, a professor at Brazil's Insper business school, who worked in one of Lemann, Telles and Sicupira's businesses in the 1990s.Last month's Heinz-Kraft merger turned Lemann into a food tycoon, now leading the third largest food and beverage conglomerate in the US.Brazil - from hype to slowdown:In the 2000s:Massive offshore oil discovered20 million people lifted from povertyAchieved investment grade rating in credit agenciesWon bids to host Olympics and World CupNow:Austerity measures and spending cutsLarge scale Petrobras corruption scandal0.1% GDP growth in 2014Rising inflation (7.7% compared with a target of 4.5%) and unemployment (5.9% up from 4.8% in January 2014)Currency close to its lowest point in 12 years - $1 is worth almost twice as much as five years agoIt has been almost a decade since the business world saw the rise of another ambitious Brazilian - mining tycoon Eike Batista.For much of the past 10 years, Batista - a flashy maverick with an extravagant lifestyle - was the world's seventh richest billionaire, and seen by many as the international face of Brazil's then vibrant economic growth on the world stage.Much of Batista's wealth was made during a cycle of high commodity prices. But once that cycle came to an end, a mixture of economic downturn and bad decisions meant he lost much of his lustre and fortune.Discreet lifestyleIn a way, Batista's story is a chronicle of Brazil's journey from hype to economic downturn, in which the fortunes of South America's largest country roughly followed the same timescale.Now the subject of a series of criminal charges his fall from grace was absolute, while Lemann claimed the post of Brazil's richest person.Many commentators see him as the \"anti-Batista\" - a prudent manager with a low profile and discreet lifestyle who is not given to grandiose statements.\n                        The maker of Budweiser is also owned by 3G Capital\n                    \n                But just as with Batista in the 2000s, Lemann now seems like an appropriate choice to be the \"face\" of Brazil's tougher economic reality in 2015.His philosophy of cost-cutting and efficiency savings is currently in vogue in his home country - as the government turns to austerity measures in a bid to put the Brics nation back on a path of sustainable growth.But Prof Hidalgo says 3G Capital is, in many ways, the opposite of the typical Brazilian industry. Their firms have discipline, high productivity and low waste - qualities many companies in Brazil are still lacking today.\"Brazilian businesses have much to learn from them,\" says the professor.\n                        Eike Batista has lost much of his fortune\n                    \n                Brazil's government must surely be hoping that the country's fortunes also mirror one of its most successful sons.\n    ", "newspaper": "BBC", "id": 119, "pubdate": "Tue, 07 Apr 2015 05:24:31 +0530", "title": "Brazil\u2019s burger king likes his companies lean"}, {"content": "Installing a temporary ice rink in your home and inviting replicas of the Disney on Ice team to perform, may seem a bit over-the-top for a child's fifth birthday party.But this is exactly what one client asked luxury events firm Quintessentially Events &amp; Weddings to organise.\nIf you don't do a big party you're not a bad parentProf Bill Doherty, Birthdays Without Pressure\nFor another child's winter birthday, the firm created \"a bringing the outside in\" themed party, which involved installing an indoor lawn complete with trees, flowers, swings and slides.The price tag for events like this can stretch to a dizzying \u00a3100,000, says event manger Chloe Astin.After all, cocktails and canap\u00e9s for the adults, and party bags including tiny Tiffany necklaces for the kids, don't come cheap.Party inflationBut I can't be alone among parents feeling that this pressure to throw ever-more-fancy parties for our kids and their increasingly hard-to-impress friends is getting out of control.My son is just five but has already been to actress-led drama parties; a pizza making session in a restaurant kitchen; a T-shirt printing workshop; and even a theme park hotel sleepover.

But he says he can organise something \"a level up from what you would do yourself\" from \u00a35,000.Ostentatious kids' parties such as these are relatively rare. Quintessentially organises a maximum of two a year, while Mr Duggan says he organises between five and eight.Hollywood howlersYet even at the more normal end of the scale, many parents are spending more on their child's special day.The Young Film Academy, whose main business is running film making courses for young people, organised 150 children's film parties last year, up from 120 in 2013. While prices start at \u00a3540, almost half of the bookings were for its most expensive MoviePartie starting at \u00a31,950, which stars the birthday child and their friends in a Hollywood-style epic\n                        At Young Film Academy children can star in their own Hollywood-style film\n                    \n                \"There's a real sense from parents that they want to do something different from the usual parties,\" says director James Walker.The fragmented nature of the party market - which includes cake, hall hire and entertainment - makes costs difficult to monitor. But insurer LV's latest annual survey of the cost of raising a child from birth until 21 put the total at \u00a3229,951, with its \"other\" category - which includes birthday and Christmas presents, as well as driving lessons - increasing by 60.2% between 2003 and 2015.On average, parents spend \u00a3135 on their child's party, with one-in-six parents admitting to splashing out over \u00a3300, according to parenting website Netmums.Given that there are nearly eight million families with dependent kids in the UK, the party market could be worth nearly \u00a31.1bn.Affluenza?Of course, having a few friends over for cake does not cost that much, but then that's rarely on the agenda these days.While a mother billing a five-year-old \u00a315.95 for failing to attend her child's birthday party made the headlines earlier this year, the fact the party was at a dry ski slope went largely unremarked.Yet it's a good example of how children's parties have become less simple affairs. \n                        The days of jelly and ice-cream in the back garden appear to be over\n                    \n                The trend seems to be part of what author Oliver James termed \"affluenza\" - an epidemic of obsessive, envious, keeping-up-with-the-Joneses.Sarah Ockwell-Smith, mother-of-four and founder of the Gentle Parenting website, says the media circus surrounding celebrities has helped to push the party bar higher. But ultimately, the motivation to make a big deal out of relatively minor milestones all stems from the parents, she believes.As she points out, a young child can often find all the fuss and attention overwhelming, resulting in tears of exasperation rather than tears of joy.Her advice to parents is to \"think about who you're doing it for and what will make your child happy.\"\n                        Young children often don't react to a big event in the way their parents expect\n                    \n                Present-free birthdays?Bill Doherty, professor of Family Social Science at the University of Minnesota, founded US group, Birthdays Without Pressure, for precisely these reasons.He says the group stemmed from local parents' dissatisfaction with the escalation of children's birthday parties, and a sense that parents were creating the problem themselves.He credits the group with having \"some influence\" in the growth of \"present free\" birthdays in the US - the invitation makes it clear there are to be no gifts, or that a donation to charity should be made instead.But he cautions that the idea only works if all the parents agree collectively not to have party bags or presents.\n                        Not all children will appreciate a present-free birthday\n                    \n                Not making this crystal clear can have unfortunate consequences.One member of his group hosted a party where one invitee who didn't receive a goody bag declared the party \"a rip off\", prompting the birthday girl to burst into tears.He says it's also important to be honest with a child about the reasons for not having presents,.Other group members suffered the humiliation of having neighbours fundraise to pay for a party they thought the parents couldn't afford.\"It's about giving parents permission to simplify their plans to fit with their family values,\" says Prof Doherty. \"There isn't just one way to do this. \"If you don't do a big party you're not a bad parent.\"\n    ", "newspaper": "BBC", "id": 120, "pubdate": "Mon, 06 Apr 2015 04:31:09 +0530", "title": "How much?

Despite the dip on Thursday morning, crude prices have risen around 15 percent since the beginning of April and are back to levels reached in February, which marked the 2015 highs.

A drop in exports reduces US economic growth. Citing the dollar's impact, the IMF on Tuesday downgraded the outlook for the US economy. The IMF now expects economic growth of 3.1 per cent both this year and next. That's solid _ and an improvement on 2014's 2.4 per cent expansion _ but it's down from the IMF's January forecast of 3.6 per cent growth in 2015 and 3.3 per cent growth in 2016. Meanwhile, Japan and Europe are poised to benefit from the dollar's might. The IMF predicts the Japanese economy will grow 1 per cent this year versus an earlier forecast of 0.6 per cent. It also upgraded the forecast for the 19 countries that use the euro currency to 1.5 per cent growth this year (up from a January forecast of 1.2 per cent). FINANCIAL STABILITY In the emerging market countries of Asia and Latin America, the stronger dollar cuts two ways. Yes, it gives exporters a lift, but it also poses a threat to financial stability. Enticed by low interest rates, emerging market countries borrowed heavily in US dollars over the past decade. From 2005 to 2015, dollar-denominated debt _ mostly corporate bonds and loans _ shot up from $262 billion to $837 billion in the emerging markets of Asia and from $586 billion to $963 billion in Latin America, according to the Institute of International Finance. As the dollar rises, it takes more local currency to generate enough dollars to meet loan payments. Emerging market corporate borrowers could get squeezed. The pain could spread if those companies suddenly withdrew deposits from local banks to meet their US dollar payments, or if the investors who own the emerging market bonds get rattled and sell them in a panic. In a report Wednesday, the IMF warned that ``financial risks have increased in many emerging markets'' and said a stronger dollar and weaker local currencies create ``balance sheet strains for indebted emerging market firms'' and for governments. TOURISM The strong dollar makes European vacations cheaper for American tourists. Booking.com estimates that the average price for a four-star hotel room in Paris, Rome, Barcelona, Amsterdam and Berlin is down 21 per cent from March 2014 because of the dollar's rise against the euro. The company calculates that an American could spend 14 days in Barcelona for the price of seven days in Palm Springs, California. Lyssandros Tsilidis, president of the Hellenic Association of Travel and Tourist Agents, said Greece has seen a 15 per cent to 20 per cent increase in reservations from the US _ Europe's biggest long-haul market _ compared to the same time last year. Spain saw a 12 per cent increase in January and almost 19 per cent in February.

Now, after a gap of more than a year, government agencies are lining up nearly Rs 40,000 crores of bonds in the next few months, but the yields may be lower by as much as a one-and-a-half percentage points, thanks to falling  interest rates and rising investor appetite for such bonds.  Indian Railways Finance Corporation (IRFC), may obtain the highest allocation of about Rs 15,000-17,000 crore to issue such securities aimed at tapping retail money to meet the country's infrastructure needs.The rate of interest is likely to be in the range of 7-7.25% with a spread or gap of 75-85 basis points below the ten-year benchmark bond yield. These rates are lower than 8.75-9% that such bonds offered in fiscal 2014. However, tax is not payable on the interest earned on such bonds, making them look more attractive than taxable debt instruments. \"Tax-free bonds will evince interest from retail investors, but it has to come at the right time before interest rates slid further,\" said Ajay Manglunia,  senior vice-president at  Edelweiss Securities. \"Any rate above 7% is enough to attract retail investors, who are mostly long-term investors,\" he said. \"Some high net worth individuals too would be investing with an aim for capital appreciation.\"The government has already approved state-owned IRFC and the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI), to sell such bonds.Railway minister Suresh Prabhu has announced ambitious plans to revamp the ailing railways, and has promised even bullet trains. In his Budget speech, he had said that about Rs 1.27 lakh crore would be spent on renovating tracks and other safety measures, and Rs 7.29 lakh crore on capital expenditure next five years. The ministry also intends to fast track the sanctioned works on 7,000 km of double/third/fourth lines and commission 1,200 km in 2015-16 at an investment of Rs 8,686 crore. Prabhu had also announced plans to focus on PPPs to meet the funding gap.So is the case with NHAI. Roads minister Nitin Gadkari has targeted to award 15,000 kms of roads in two fiscals by March 2016. The target was at 8,500 km in 2014-15. The government is also working on hybrid models to raise funds for these projects since many of the companies in this segment are already sunk in debt. For the irrigation sector, many including  National Bank for Agriculture and Development (Nabard), Housing and Urban Development Corporation (Hudco), Rural Electrification Corporation (REC) and India Infrastructure Finance Company (IIFCL), have proposed to the economic affairs and finance ministries for approval to tap the bond market.

Sharp is on track for its third annual net loss in four years due to weakness in its liquid crystal display (LCD) and TV operations. The lenders will inject a combined 200 billion yen ($1.7 billion) in a debt-for-equity swap, while Sharp will cut 5,000 jobs, scale back its North American television operations and is also likely to agree to spinning off its LCD unit, the source said.Relief that Sharp was extracting a bailout from its lenders, sent its stock 4 percent higher in morning trade.The parties are unlikely to make any announcement on Thursday after CEO Kozo Takahashi meets with bankers to finalize a deal, the source said, declining to be identified as he was not authorized to speak on the matter.Sharp spokeswoman Miyuki Nakayama said the company was considering various options, but nothing had been decided.

The shopping case, on which the EU has had the most complaints dating back the longest time, could potentially set a precedent for concerns over Google's search products for hotels, flights and other services.\n        \n        Vestager, a Dane who took over the politically charged case in November, announced the moves on the eve of a high-profile visit to the United States. Her findings follow nearly five years of investigation and abortive efforts by her Spanish predecessor, Joaquin Almunia, to strike deals with Google.\"I am concerned that the company has given an unfair advantage to its own comparison shopping service, in breach of EU antitrust rules,\" she said. Google could face fines, she warned, if the Commission proves its case that it has used its \"near monopoly\" in Europe to push Google Shopping ahead of rivals for the past seven years.Google rejected the charges. Its shares closed up 0.40 percent on Wednesday after earlier losing 1 percent.Meanwhile, Google's rivals are pushing U.S. antitrust enforcers to investigate the use of Android, two people with knowledge of the matter said.    \n        \n        Analysts said the EU charges were unlikely to hurt Google's evaluation because it reflected the regulatory risk. If recent history of EU probes into tech companies is an indicator, however, Google shares may have trouble moving forward until the issue is resolved.In its first reaction, the Mountain View, California-based company said in a blog post that it strongly disagreed with the EU's statement of objections and would make the case that its products have fostered competition and benefited consumers.\"Android has been a key player in spurring this competition and choice, lowering prices and increasing choice for everyone (there are over 18,000 different devices available today),\" it said of its free operating system for mobile devices.The Commission, whose control of antitrust matters across the wealthy 28-nation bloc gives it a major say in the fate of global corporations, can fine firms up to 10 percent of their annual sales, in Google's case up to 6.2 billion euros. If it finds that companies are abusing a dominant market position, the EU regulator can also demand sweeping changes to their business practices, as it did with U.S. software giant Microsoft in 2004 and chip-maker Intel in 2009. Its record antitrust fine was 1.09 billion euros on Intel.Competition lawyer Bertold Baer-Bouyssiere at DLA Piper in Brussels said: \"Even more than Microsoft, this case will shape the landscape for the digital sectors in the years to come.\"\"NOT ANTI-AMERICAN\"Rejecting suggestions - recently from President Barack Obama himself - that the EU was pursuing an anti-American, protectionist policy, Vestager, a liberal former economy minister, said about a quarter of the firms which had complained to the EU authorities about Google were themselves U.S.-owned.She insisted that political pressure had played no part in her decision to accuse Google. Nationality or successful market domination were not issues for her, only the abuse of market power.In a mark of the emotion U.S. tech hegemony evokes among Europeans who fear economic eclipse, the EU parliament last year voted a non-binding resolution urging the Commission to consider breaking up Google. The EU action so far is unlikely to have such a dramatic effect, though it could crimp future business.Google now had a chance to explain itself, Vestager said, and the case might be settled by it making further commitments to change its products. She wanted a change in the \"principle\" underlying searches rather than a redesign of current Web pages or tweaks to algorithms by which Google ranks results. That way, any remedy would be \"future-proof\" against technological change.Of the investigation into Android, which analysts said could prove a bigger threat to Google's future profitability, Vestager said: \"I want to make sure the markets in this area can flourish without anticompetitive constraints imposed by any company.\"The focus on the ranking of searches for shopping sites did not address all complaints lodged with the Commission. Vestager stressed her antitrust staff would continue to investigate other areas of concern, including alleged \"web scraping\" to copy rivals' content, and restrictive practices on advertising.A final resolution - quite possibly involving court action if Google does not choose to settle - is likely to take many months and probably years, legal experts said. CRITICS WELCOMEGoogle's critics welcomed the decision to pursue the U.S. giant, though many industry experts believe the action is unlikely to markedly shift existing business their way. Rather, by firing a shot across Google's bows, it may favor competitors in new areas as technology develops, a priority for the new European Commission led by Jean-Claude Juncker, which wants to foster home-grown enterprise.Michael Weber of German online mapping service Hot-Map.com told Reuters: \"After so many years with everyone thinking that we were crazy, it's good to see something happening. The sun is shining today.\"Vestager's action won cross-party endorsement in the European Parliament. In a statement headlined \"Even Uncle Google must play fair\", German lawmaker Manfred Weber, floor leader of the largest conservative group, said: \"Internet is not the Wild West - there are rules on the web that must also be respected.\"French Socialists Pervenche Beres and Virginie Roziere applauded the Commission for \"at long last\" taking action against \"the threat posed to the European economy\" and renewed their call for the breakup of Google.American domination of the Internet and other new technology sectors has prompted a mixture of admiration and anxiety in Europe.U.S. authorities that looked at Google's business have taken no action. Vestager said she was not concerned that that difference in approach weakened her case: \"It's a different market,\" she told Reuters. While Google has over 90 percent of the EU search market, it has only two thirds of its home market.The Initiative for a Competitive Online Marketplace, an alliance of businesses, applauded the Commission for taking what it called \"decisive action to end Google\u2019s years of abusive behavior in its long-running antitrust case\". German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel welcomed Vestager's action. Germany, backed by major companies in the EU's biggest economy, has been particularly vocal in pressing the Commission to act against Google.Axel Springer chief Mathias Doepfner told the German media group's shareholders in Berlin on Tuesday that Vestager's predecessor Almunia's efforts to negotiate a deal with Google would have been a \"shoddy compromise\" and praised Vestager for being \"more determined, quicker and more true to the facts\".

The decision by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Gerber means GM may avoid potentially billions of dollars in liability, as well as the cost of defending those lawsuits, although claims arising from GM's conduct after its bankruptcy will not be affected. The plaintiffs will have to file their claims against the financially strapped \u201cOld GM,\u201d the shell company comprised of bad assets GM shed in bankruptcy. As of October, Old GM's main assets were worth about $9.25 billion, versus roughly $32 billion in claims, a recovery of about 29 cents on the dollar for trust creditors.Judge Gerber held that GM economic-loss plaintiffs can still bring claims against New GM based solely on its post-bankruptcy conduct.A lead lawyer for ignition-switch plaintiffs, Steve Berman, said that he was pleased the judge would let claims based on New GM's conduct proceed. However, he said, plaintiffs intended to fight the ruling on appeal. Gerber said he would certify the case for direct review by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. A GM spokesman, Jim Cain, said that Gerber properly concluded that claims based on old GM's conduct were barred and that the plaintiffs still had to prove the merits of their claims against new GM.CENTER OF CLAIMSPlaintiffs' claims center on a faulty ignition switch in some older vehicle models that could slip out of position, cutting power to brakes, steering and airbags. Last year GM recalled 2.6 million vehicles with the switch, and later issued additional recalls for other safety issues.\u00a0The defect was linked to nearly 160 injuries and 84 deaths. The claims mostly allege loss in vehicle value, as GM has already agreed to compensate most injury and death claimants through a separate fund. However, some personal injury and death claimants who were not compensated through the fund, because they were either ineligible or opted out, are among those now suing the company.Shares in GM rose 45 cents to $37.39 in after-hours trading following the decision. GM\u2019s 2009 bankruptcy essentially split the company, with New GM purchasing the profitable business operations and Old GM retaining burdensome liabilities. Under the sale, New GM expressly disavowed responsibility for most product-related claims on cars made before the bankruptcy. Plaintiffs sought to pierce that shield on grounds that they could not have known they might have legal claims at the time of the bankruptcy. Despite having been given notice of the sale, they said, GM covered up the switch defect and deprived them of their day in court. In his ruling, Gerber cited due process \u201cfailures\u201d but said they did not rise to the level of a violation because plaintiffs failed to show they were prejudiced by insufficient notice. \u201cA denial of notice need not result in an automatic win for the party that failed to get appropriate notice the first time around,\u201d Gerber said. Nearly 200 lawsuits, many of which have been brought on behalf of potentially millions of economic-loss plaintiffs, have been consolidated in New York federal court. Plaintiffs are seeking an estimated $7 billion to $10 billion in lost vehicle value, the ruling said. GM feared a damaging financial hit if the judge ruled that the bankruptcy settlement did not shield GM from lawsuits over vehicles made before its bankruptcy. GM executives cited the risk among the reasons why they were reluctant earlier this year to return to investors a larger share of its $25 billion cash trove.In March, after a group of investors mounted a public push for $8 billion in stock buybacks, GM announced it would launch a $5 billion stock buyback and boost dividend payouts by another $5 billion through 2016.

The shopping case, on which the EU has had the most complaints dating back the longest time, could potentially set a precedent for concerns over Google's search products for hotels, flights and other services.\n        \n        Vestager, a Dane who took over the politically charged case in November, announced the moves on the eve of a high-profile visit to the United States. Her findings follow nearly five years of investigation and abortive efforts by her Spanish predecessor, Joaquin Almunia, to strike deals with Google.\"I am concerned that the company has given an unfair advantage to its own comparison shopping service, in breach of EU antitrust rules,\" she said. Google could face fines, she warned, if the Commission proves its case that it has used its \"near monopoly\" in Europe to push Google Shopping ahead of rivals for the past seven years.Google rejected the charges. Its shares closed up 0.40 percent on Wednesday after earlier losing 1 percent.Meanwhile, Google's rivals are pushing U.S. antitrust enforcers to investigate the use of Android, two people with knowledge of the matter said.    \n        \n        Analysts said the EU charges were unlikely to hurt Google's evaluation because it reflected the regulatory risk. If recent history of EU probes into tech companies is an indicator, however, Google shares may have trouble moving forward until the issue is resolved.In its first reaction, the Mountain View, California-based company said in a blog post that it strongly disagreed with the EU's statement of objections and would make the case that its products have fostered competition and benefited consumers.\"Android has been a key player in spurring this competition and choice, lowering prices and increasing choice for everyone (there are over 18,000 different devices available today),\" it said of its free operating system for mobile devices.The Commission, whose control of antitrust matters across the wealthy 28-nation bloc gives it a major say in the fate of global corporations, can fine firms up to 10 percent of their annual sales, in Google's case up to 6.2 billion euros. If it finds that companies are abusing a dominant market position, the EU regulator can also demand sweeping changes to their business practices, as it did with U.S. software giant Microsoft in 2004 and chip-maker Intel in 2009. Its record antitrust fine was 1.09 billion euros on Intel.Competition lawyer Bertold Baer-Bouyssiere at DLA Piper in Brussels said: \"Even more than Microsoft, this case will shape the landscape for the digital sectors in the years to come.\"\"NOT ANTI-AMERICAN\"Rejecting suggestions - recently from President Barack Obama himself - that the EU was pursuing an anti-American, protectionist policy, Vestager, a liberal former economy minister, said about a quarter of the firms which had complained to the EU authorities about Google were themselves U.S.-owned.She insisted that political pressure had played no part in her decision to accuse Google. Nationality or successful market domination were not issues for her, only the abuse of market power.In a mark of the emotion U.S. tech hegemony evokes among Europeans who fear economic eclipse, the EU parliament last year voted a non-binding resolution urging the Commission to consider breaking up Google. The EU action so far is unlikely to have such a dramatic effect, though it could crimp future business.Google now had a chance to explain itself, Vestager said, and the case might be settled by it making further commitments to change its products. She wanted a change in the \"principle\" underlying searches rather than a redesign of current Web pages or tweaks to algorithms by which Google ranks results. That way, any remedy would be \"future-proof\" against technological change.Of the investigation into Android, which analysts said could prove a bigger threat to Google's future profitability, Vestager said: \"I want to make sure the markets in this area can flourish without anticompetitive constraints imposed by any company.\"The focus on the ranking of searches for shopping sites did not address all complaints lodged with the Commission. Vestager stressed her antitrust staff would continue to investigate other areas of concern, including alleged \"web scraping\" to copy rivals' content, and restrictive practices on advertising.A final resolution - quite possibly involving court action if Google does not choose to settle - is likely to take many months and probably years, legal experts said. CRITICS WELCOMEGoogle's critics welcomed the decision to pursue the U.S. giant, though many industry experts believe the action is unlikely to markedly shift existing business their way. Rather, by firing a shot across Google's bows, it may favor competitors in new areas as technology develops, a priority for the new European Commission led by Jean-Claude Juncker, which wants to foster home-grown enterprise.Michael Weber of German online mapping service Hot-Map.com told Reuters: \"After so many years with everyone thinking that we were crazy, it's good to see something happening. The sun is shining today.\"Vestager's action won cross-party endorsement in the European Parliament. In a statement headlined \"Even Uncle Google must play fair\", German lawmaker Manfred Weber, floor leader of the largest conservative group, said: \"Internet is not the Wild West - there are rules on the web that must also be respected.\"French Socialists Pervenche Beres and Virginie Roziere applauded the Commission for \"at long last\" taking action against \"the threat posed to the European economy\" and renewed their call for the breakup of Google.American domination of the Internet and other new technology sectors has prompted a mixture of admiration and anxiety in Europe.U.S. authorities that looked at Google's business have taken no action. Vestager said she was not concerned that that difference in approach weakened her case: \"It's a different market,\" she told Reuters. While Google has over 90 percent of the EU search market, it has only two thirds of its home market.The Initiative for a Competitive Online Marketplace, an alliance of businesses, applauded the Commission for taking what it called \"decisive action to end Google\u2019s years of abusive behavior in its long-running antitrust case\". German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel welcomed Vestager's action. Germany, backed by major companies in the EU's biggest economy, has been particularly vocal in pressing the Commission to act against Google.Axel Springer chief Mathias Doepfner told the German media group's shareholders in Berlin on Tuesday that Vestager's predecessor Almunia's efforts to negotiate a deal with Google would have been a \"shoddy compromise\" and praised Vestager for being \"more determined, quicker and more true to the facts\".

U.S. crude jumped more than 5 percent after a lower-than-expected build of U.S. crude stockpiles.Intel jumped 4.25 percent to $32.83 after the chipmaker said late on Tuesday it expects flat revenue for the entire year despite some weakness in the first quarter.Investors have feared the March-quarter earnings season, just getting under way, would be crippled by low oil prices, a strong dollar and extreme weather in the eastern United States. First-quarter profits for S&amp;P 500 companies are seen dropping 2.6 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.   \"Companies can jump over a bar that's about as low as a limbo stick,\" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago. \"Beating expectations should be relatively easy.\"Of the 36 companies in the S&amp;P 500 that have reported so far, 81 percent beat expectations, better than the 63 percent of companies exceeding expectations in a typical quarter.But just 47 percent of companies exceeded revenue expectations, worse than 61 percent seen in a typical quarter. That suggests companies are bolstering their bottom lines by cutting costs instead of by expanding their businesses.U.S. shares also benefited after the European Central Bank said it remained committed to its full asset-buying program to revive the euro zone economy.The strong dollar hurts U.S. companies dependent on overseas sales, while slumping oil prices erode the profits of energy companies.But many industrial and transportation companies benefit from cheap oil and its derivatives.

It will also fill gaps in its product portfolio with Alcatel-Lucent's technology in optical transmission and Internet routers, which help telecom operators handle the ever-increasing volume of data brought on by users surfing the web on their smartphones and watching Netflix at home.While Huawei does have a complete product line across both fixed and mobile, Ericsson does not and may have to react with deal-making or partnerships, executives said.Nokia will give Alcatel-Lucent shareholders 0.55 shares in the combined company for each of their old shares, putting 33.5 percent of the entity in Alcatel shareholders' hands if the tender offer is fully taken up.The deal will be finalised in the first half of 2016 and is expected to result in 900 million euros of operating cost savings by the end of 2019, the companies said on Wednesday.\n        \n        Nokia shares fell 1.5 percent, adding to Tuesday's 3.6 percent fall, while Alcatel-Lucent fell 15.5 percent, giving up most of the gains it made on Tuesday when the talks were first acknowledged by the companies.Nokia initially approached Alcatel-Lucent about buying only the wireless business but was rebuffed, leading to the broader deal, Alcatel boss Michel Combes told Reuters in an interview.The deal carries significant risks, however. The track record of mergers in the sector - including the two that gave birth to Nokia and Alcatel-Lucent a decade ago - has been poor. Prior deals were plagued by the difficulty of cutting costs in an R&amp;D intensive business, rivals stealing contracts while the companies were distracted by their integrations, and struggles over power within the married firms.Nokia CEO Rajeev Suri sought to reassure.\"This is not a joint venture, so there will be no governance issues,\" he said on a call with investors. \"We will take a no politics, no nonsense approach to running the business, and have learned from past mistakes.\"FRENCH JOBS PLEDGENokia pledged to keep France as \"a vibrant center of the combined company\" and not to cut jobs beyond what Alcatel had already planned, especially protecting research and development sites at Villarceaux and Lannion.Economy Minister Emanuel Macron said in a statement late on Wednesday that the overall jobs pledge would hold for two years after the deal closes. He and Alcatel's Combes also announced an extra 500 research jobs in France, adding to the existing 2,000. Alcatel has 6,000 employees in France.France made maintaining jobs a condition for its backing the deal, raising concerns over job cuts in Finland where Nokia employs about 6,900.\"At first the deal sounded like very good news. But given that there will likely be job cuts, and the fact that it is much more expensive to lay off people in France than in Finland, the outlook is not that bright anymore,\" the head of the Finnish engineers' union, Pertti Porokari, said.\"I truly hope that Finnish politicians would also show some patriotism here.\"The Finnish government did not demand that jobs be protected but underlined the Nordic country's know-how in technology.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nokia sold its once-dominant mobile handset business to Microsoft last year after struggling to compete with smartphones by Apple and Samsung. That deal left it with the network unit, a smaller map unit and a portfolio of technology patents.Nokia said its growth profile would be improved by the deal and predicted a sales growth rate of about 3.5 percent for 2014 to 2019. Nevertheless some investors remained concerned.\"The integration will be a difficult task, it will easily take a year or two, and the management group must focus on it heavily. For an investor seeking returns this year, it is clear that Nokia looks less interesting after this move,\" said Juha Varis, a fund manager at Danske Capital whose fund owned 0.06 percent of Nokia shares as of end-March.He also said that leaving France out of the cost-cutting program must have a negative impact on the corporate culture.Other analysts, however, said that Nokia and CEO Suri had a good record on restructuring.\"There is no reason to doubt that this deal too wouldn't increase shareholder value... We know that there are risks related to France and the cost cuts, but I believe that Nokia has calculated a margin of safety to the deal price,\" Nordnet brokerage strategist, Jukka Oksaharju, said.Separately, Nokia confirmed it was exploring the sale of its HERE mapping unit, which some analysts value at up to 6.9 billion euros. It also said further asset sales could be undertaken once the deal was completed.JPMorgan advised Nokia on the takeover, and boutique investment bank Zaoui &amp; Co. advised Alcatel-Lucent.

The haircare business is worth about $7 billion based on annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of around $500 million, the sources said.

In New York, a march was planned to Times Square during the evening rush hour, organizers said.Jumal Tarver, 36, said he cooks and cleans at a franchised McDonald's in Manhattan but cannot make ends meet on his pay of $8.75 per hour.He said he must rely on public assistance on top of his wages.\"It's hard for me to provide for my daughters with $8.75,\" he said.Organizers said they chose to mobilize on April 15, the U.S. deadline for filing federal income tax returns, to highlight their complaint that many workers must rely on public assistance.The campaign for a living wage has been building on low-paid workers' position that the U.S. federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour is not enough to lift them from poverty.Fast-food and retail chains are starting to respond, but their wage increases are generally less than organizers demand.Wal-Mart Stores Inc this year said it would raise its minimum pay to $9 an hour in April, and $10 in 2016. Target Corp and T.J.

In Berlin, a Finance Ministry spokeswoman said euro zone countries could not realistically pay out new aid to Greece this month because of the complex process required.Slovak Finance Minister Peter Kazimir echoed Schaeuble's gloom about the chances of a breakthrough next week.\"Given that we have lost a lot of time, I am skeptical,\" Kazimir told reporters after a Slovak cabinet meeting.Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, elected on a promise to end austerity, is balking at pension and labor market reforms to which his conservative predecessor had agreed.EU sources say Brussels is pushing Athens towards more rapidly applicable measures to liberalize markets for products and services instead.Athens is dangerously close to running out of cash, with its reserves expected to dip into negative territory after April 20, a source familiar with the matter has previously said. The government could get by for another couple of weeks by using one-off measures or trying to raid the last remaining cash reserves at state entities -- a tactic it has been using in recent months.But without a deal in Riga, Athens could be forced to choose between making 1.6 billion euros of wage and pension payments at the end of this month or about 1 billion euros of debt payments due in May, mostly to the IMF.  WORLD WATCHINGThe world is watching.Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis will be in Washington later this week for G20/IMF meetings at which his ministry said he will meet both U.S. President Barack Obama and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi.The German finance ministry spokeswoman said that, even after a ministerial agreement, Greece would have to pass new laws and its creditors would want to review progress.\"If people are under the impression that aid could be paid out in April, I think this is wrong,\" she said.In the meantime, the ECB is keeping Greek banks afloat with emergency loans to cope with heavy deposit outflows and raised the ceiling for that lending to 73 billion euros on Tuesday.Draghi said on Wednesday there was no date for ending it, adding that it was \"entirely depending on the conditions that will be in place\" after talks between Greece and its lenders. Speculation has been rife in recent days that Tsipras may call a snap election if Greece does not secure outside help, something his government has strongly denied.\"There is no point in calling elections,\" State Minister Alekos Flabouraris told Greek TV. \"They took place two months ago, we received a specific mandate which we will serve. We do not need elections, I rule it out 100 percent,\" he said.Athens sold 812.5 million euros ($859 million) of three-month Treasury bills on Wednesday, successfully covering the entire amount it sought to raise in the second of two auctions this month that tested its ability to find funds.European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis told Reuters on Monday that Greece was not moving fast enough to draw up structural reforms and time was running short to prevent it running out of cash.The head of the euro zone's rescue fund, Klaus Regling, said in Washington that Greece could reach debt sustainability without having to impose another \"haircut\" on creditors, as it did in 2012 when private bondholders took heavy writedowns.

Snowy winter weighed on activity early in 2015. Labor disruptions at normally busy West Coast ports, as well as the dollar and softer global demand have been a constraint.\"This provides some confirmation on the disappointing growth performance in the first quarter. The absence of a lift in the other forward-looking indicators suggests that the U.S. economic recovery is struggling to regain any traction,\" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York. Industrial production fell 0.6 percent after edging up 0.1 percent in February, the Fed said. March's decline was the largest since August 2012 and was worse than economists' expectations for only a 0.3 percent drop.A 17.7 percent plunge in oil and gas well drilling pulled mining production down 0.7 percent in March, marking the third straight month of declines in mining output. Crude oil has lost more than half of its value since last June, resulting in a sharp drop in well drilling activity. Companies in the oil field are also either postponing or cutting back on capital expenditure projects.Separately, the Fed in its Beige Book report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts nationwide said investment in oil and gas drilling had declined and related layoffs were reported by \"multiple\" regions. Caterpillar Inc early this year cut its 2015 profit outlook and warned lower oil prices would hurt its energy equipment business.Last month, utilities production tumbled 5.9 percent, also weighing on industrial production.\"We do not see the emerging picture as supporting the hand of those who have been arguing for an earlier Fed rate hike,\" said Anthony Karydakis, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak in New York.Most economists have pushed back their expectations for the first rate hike to either September or October from June. Others believe monetary policy will only be tightened in 2016. The Fed has kept interest rates near zero since December 2008. Data including for retail sales, housing starts, inventories, trade and manufacturing suggest the economy grew at a sub-1.5 percent annual rate in the first quarter after a 2.2 percent pace in the October-December quarter.U.S. Treasury prices rose as the data supported bets the Fed was likely to wait longer to raise rates. Stocks rose while the dollar fell against a basket of currencies.WEAK MANUFACTURINGFor the first quarter, industrial production declined at an annual rate of 1.0 percent, the first quarterly decrease since the second quarter of 2009.Oil and gas well drilling and servicing, which tumbled at a 69.8 percent rate, accounted for the bulk of the drop in industrial output in the first quarter. While manufacturing output ticked up 0.1 percent in March, the first gain since last November, it fell at a 1.2 percent rate in the first quarter, the first decline since the second quarter of 2009. The soft trend could persist for a while. In a separate report, the New York Fed said its Empire State general business conditions index fell to -1.19 in April from March's 6.90. This was the first negative read for the index since December.The weakness in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy, has been attributed to the buoyant dollar, bad weather and supply chain disruptions from the ports dispute. Softer growth in Europe and Asia, especially China where the economy expanded at its slowest pace in six years in the first quarter, has also been a drag.The dollar has gained 13 percent against the United States' main trading partners since last June, which economists say is equivalent to a 0.5 percentage point interest rate hike.\"The dollar's strength may be taking some of the oomph out of factory production, which had been on a tear until December last year,\" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.\"Time will tell whether this is real weakness or simply a bump on the road to prosperity. Our guess remains the economy comes back strong later on this spring.\"Companies like Microsoft Corp and Procter &amp; Gamble Co, the world's largest household products maker, and healthcare conglomerate Johnson &amp; Johnson have warned  the dollar will hit sales and profits this year.

The poll had a credibility interval of plus or minus 2.6 percentage points. If calculated based on 2014 U.S. Census projections, and excluding younger teens, this could mean potential sales of about 15 million watches, if those who said they intended to buy follow through with an actual purchase.   Wall Street estimates had varied widely between 10 million and 32 million worldwide sales in 2015. Van Baker, an analyst at tech research firm Gartner, said the Reuters poll results indicated a \"pretty high percentage\" was interested in buying.\"It should serve Apple well if they can even get close to that,\" he said.As far as overall interest in the watch as opposed to intending to buy it, the poll showed that 18 percent of respondents were \"very\" or \"somewhat\" interested versus 76 percent who showed no interest.Highest interest at 34 percent was among men aged 18 to 28, the same age and gender bracket that gave the watch the highest \"cool factor\" at 53 percent, compared with an overall 42 percent.People around the world flocked to Apple stores on April 10 to try on the watches, which go on sale officially on April 24, and online orders quickly outstripped supply, with most customers facing at least a month's wait.\"I already have the iPhone, the iPad, pretty much everything that Apple offers,\" said poll respondent Sefu Grady, a 37-year- old counselor living in Clinton, Mississippi.He said he was buying a basic Sport model for himself and a mid-range one for his wife for Mother's Day. Apple has not yet said how many watches have been ordered, but CEO Cook described sales as \"great.\" Shopping data firm Slice Intelligence and brokerage Cowen and Co estimated preorders on the first day at about 1 million in the United States.Samsung Electronics, Sony Corp and LG Electronics have all released their own smartwatches, many of them powered by software developed by Internet company Google Inc.None have given sales figures but independent researcher Smartwatch Group estimates that 6.8 million smartwatches were sold worldwide last year, led by Samsung with about 1.2 million units.The Apple Watch, priced from $349 for a basic Sport model to a $17,000 gold timepiece, lets users check email, listen to music and make phone calls when paired with an iPhone. Reviews have generally praised its style but criticized battery life and slow-loading apps. According to the poll, adults aged between 30 and 39 were the most likely buyers, with 13 percent saying they planed to buy an Apple Watch, followed by 10 percent of 18-to-29-year-olds.Just under a third of respondents said they already own an iPhone.Not surprisingly, iPhone owners are more likely to spend money on the new Apple gadget, with about 15 percent saying they planed to buy. Among those polled who do not own an iPhone, 8 percent said they would consider switching to an iPhone in order to purchase an Apple Watch.Baker at Gartner said many potential buyers will end up holding off until the second version of the watch, likely to appear next year.\"We may see a high level of interest. Apple will sell a few million fairly quickly, but then things might flatten out a little,\" he said.

While efforts made by the FTIL group to get relief from courts did not succeed, the matter is before company law board. \u00a0However, the court has directed the government to give two weeks\u2019 time for appeal before any such merger order passed is implemented. In the meanwhile, the government has put up a proposed swap-ratio for the merger.\u00a0&#13;\n&#13;\n\tOne of the key arguments against the merger proposal is that it would affect some 62,000 small shareholders of FTIL. While there have been many supporters of this argument, the following blog (Read here) argued against its merits in October.\u00a0&#13;\n&#13;\n\tRecently, the FTIL group has come up with a settlement proposal, which seeks to settle dues of smaller of the investors. \u00a0Accordingly, the plan under which contributions of brokers are also sought, NSEL wants to pay off the smaller investors with dues of less than Rs 10 lakh each. These 6,445 investors who account for over half of the 12,735 hit by the scam, would be paid off their entire dues of Rs 164 crore in the first month or so. Another 4900 wealthier clients with exposure of over Rs 10 lakh but less than a crore totaling Rs 1,345 crore are to be paid half of their dues in the first month.\u00a0&#13;\n\t\u00a0&#13;\n&#13;\n\tThat would leave about 781 entities with an exposure of over Rs 1 crore or more.\u00a0&#13;\n&#13;\n\tInvestors of NSEL organized under various groups such as NSEL investor forum, NSEL Recovery group, NAARA etc have rejected this proposal while some reports have quoted some individual investors being keen on getting settled this way.\u00a0&#13;\n&#13;\n\tThe organized group smells foul and see this as an effort to break the unity and whittle down the numbers, which will then dilute the \u2018public interest\u2019 argument which is at the heart of the government\u2019s merger plan. What is public interest? That of 781 rich entities or 62,000-odd small guys, the argument would have gone.\u00a0&#13;\n&#13;\n\tHowever, there is a catch.\u00a0&#13;\n&#13;\n\tEven assuming NSEL pulls off this ambitious pay-off plan, the number of people benefitted by this merger would be far higher than 62,000 people who are going to be affected by it.\u00a0&#13;\n&#13;\n\tAmong the entities with exposure of Rs 1 crore or more are many listed companies. Let us take the three large ones as sample. MMTC, the state-run firm, which has the largest exposure of Rs 220 crore in NSEL had 59,671 shareholders at the end of June 2013, a month before the scam broke. Today, it has 92,491 shareholders. \u00a0Similarly, India Glycols, which has an exposure of over Rs 100 crore, had 32,428 shareholders in June 2013 and 32,081 shareholders as per latest filings. Technocraft India had around 13,700 shareholders in June 2013, which is down to 13,093.\u00a0&#13;\n&#13;\n\tThus, over 105,800 shareholders of these listed firms were affected by the scam, the same way FTIL group argues that its shareholders would be affected by the merger.\u00a0&#13;\n&#13;\n\tNSEL\u2019s proposed settlement plan completely ignores the desperation of these people and keeps their companies at the end of the pecking order. \u00a0What was their fault? Like the FTIL shareholders who are carrying the can of their management\u2019s follies or the follies of people hired by their management to run the subsidiary, these shareholders have also paid a heavy price for decisions taken by their management.\u00a0&#13;\n&#13;\n\tToday, 137,665 people who hold shares in these three companies, are eagerly awaiting the merger of NSEL with FTIL, which will pave way for their companies to get back their legitimate dues and get back to profitability. There might be more such shareholders. It is safe to assume that at least two times the small shareholder interest is in favour of the merger than against it. It would be in 'public interest' for the government to provide a platform for these investors to express their views and opinions on the NSEL-FTIL merger proposal.\u00a0", "newspaper": "Business Standard", "id": 155, "pubdate": "Thu, 16 Apr 2015 08:25:00 +0530", "title": "The 1.37 lakh people who will benefit from NSEL-FTIL merger"}, {"content": "&#13;\n         &#13;\n    &#13;\n\t&#13;\n\tTwo years earlier, in April 2013, the then Union government had decided to lift some controls on the sugar industry, in place for decades. The obligation to sell 10 per cent of a mill\u2019s output to the Public Distribution System at prices below the cost of production was scrapped. So was the government's power to control the supply of sugar to the open market.Two years later, the industry says it is worse off. Banks have stayed away from providing money and investors have deserted sugar shares in a booming market. The industry is not able to pay the price of sugarcane to farmers, nor able to sell its sugar stocks.The reason is that the price of raw material, sugarcane, is still fixed by state governments. Maharashtra and Karnataka recently announced a formula which gives weight to the price of sugar before fixing the cane price that industry has to pay to farmers but it will take time to deliver fruit. (SUGAR ECONOMY)This season, prices of sugar are down and mills have huge payment dues. Countrywide dues to farmers for cane payment were Rs 19,000 crore by the end of 2014-15.If, year after year, sugar prices keep falling and arrears keep rising, why do farmers sow more cane? The reason is no other crop gives such high and assured returns. For example, in 2011-12, the Fair and Remunerative Price proposed by the central government for cane was Rs 145 a quintal; it was Rs 220 in 2014-15. No other crop has given that much return; cane is also considered a sturdy crop, less affected by abnormal weather.Abinash Verma, Director General, Indian Sugar Mills\u2019 Association (Isma), says as cane prices are determined by states, without considering final product prices, including that of sugar, \u201cfarmers get no signal of any imbalance\u201d. Hence, for some years, sowing has been static or risen, despite a falling sugar price.Hence, says Bharat Mehta, chief executive officer of Dalmia Bharat Sugar and Industries, \u201cReform specially linking the cane price with that of final products is necessary.\u201d Or, full decontrol of sugar, taking states on board.Sugar prices are down 20 per cent in the open market since partial decontrol, at a five-year low. Isma says the all-India average cost of producing sugar is Rs 28.64 a kg; in the open market, prices are 10-15 per cent lower than the cost of production in most places. It is worst in Uttar Pradesh, second largest producer state, which also has the highest price set for cane.Mehta said, \u201cThe government should build a strategic sugar reserve, incentivise more ethanol production for higher blending with petrol and get banks to restructure short-term loans and increase liquidity for mills.\u201dInvestors had better keep away from sugar stocks till more clarity emerges. In the past two years, the Business Standard index of sugar companies\u2019 share prices has grossly under-performed the benchmark indices. Taking 100 as the base of two years earlier, the BSE Sensex has risen to 151; sugar companies\u2019 index fell to 91.Satish Mishra of HDFC Securities said, \u201cWe see no structural change in the sector dynamics unless the cane price is linked to sugar prices.

Sugar mills in India pay the highest cane prices in the world.He wanted the government to link cane price to revenue realisation.According to mill owners, they are forced to sell their produce at whatever prices they get, to keep themselves afloat and also due to lack of an alternative market, which could fetch them a better price.He noted that this is the fifth consecutive year of surplus production and the closing balance as on September 30 this year, i.e., at the end of current sugar seasons of 2014-15, is expected to be 9 million tonnes. This is more than 3 million tonnes than the normative sugar requirement needed to maintain the supplies at the beginning of the next season.\u201cUnless this surplus absorbed quickly, it will continue to batter the sugar prices and bleed the sugar industry,\u201d said Verma, adding that the prices are trading at their lowest levels in almost seven years and during the last six months alone (from the beginning of the current sugar seasons of 2014-15), the ex-mill sugar prices have fallen by around Rs 7,000 a tonne of sugar.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tAs a result of low realisation from sugar, the mills are unable to recover their costs.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tAccording to him the cane price arrears as on March 31, 2015 crossed a whopping of Rs 19,000 crore compared to Rs 13,100 crore, a year ago and debt of the industry was at Rs 36,601 crore in 2012-13.&#13;\n&#13;\n\t\"Total working capital of Rs 27,000 crore is blocked due to the current fall in prices of sugar,\" claimed Verma.", "newspaper": "Business Standard", "id": 157, "pubdate": "Thu, 16 Apr 2015 00:04:00 +0530", "title": "Sugar industry asks for rationalised cane price policy across the country"}, {"content": "&#13;\n         &#13;\n    &#13;\nIndia\u2019s vegetable oil import surged 27 per cent in March due to lesser availability from domestic sources.

Industry sources said demand had begun to pick up when this took place, after being subdued for a long while.India produces about 22 million tonnes of salt in a year. Gujarat produces 18 mt. Demand is about 21 mt \u2014 that for industrial salt is 8.5 mt, for edible salt is 7.5 mt and for export is five mt.\u201cThis is the sixth or seventh time in this calendar year that there have been unseasonal rains.

Manufacturers are still under margin pressures, with prices continuing in the Rs 300 a tonne range. The unseasonal rains have washed out any production or capacity expansion plans that manufacturers had,\u201d said Ahir.\u201cThere will be decline in salt production due to unseasonal rain but this will not impact us much, since demand is already subdued. There has not been much industrial activity, as a result of which demand for salt is not likely to touch past levels.

It differs from a mutual fund (MF), where investors choose from various investment funds available in the market.

Official data shows, between April 2012 and February 2015, as many as 54 PMS firms had quit the sector.Analysts believe several small-size ones had to go because of the higher minimum order size, as well as the poor equity market performance in 2012-13, when markets lost about 25 per cent of value. In 2014, when equity markets recovered and rose about 30 per cent, many investors also used this opportunity to book profits and exit the funds altogether.

Lower demand and realisations in February led to the downside.However, the trend is expected to reverse and, importantly, sustain over the medium term. Thus, analysts are bullish on cement companies. UltraTech, ACC, Ambuja, Shree Cement, JK Lakshmi, Ramco and Dalmia Bharat are among the top picks, expected to deliver strong returns over the next one to two years. While the consensus target price of some of these companies is a little higher than current levels, investors could consider these on declines.Cement prices&#13;\nWhile cement prices recovered in March to January levels, analysts expect more upside in the June quarter, the strongest period for the industry. Analysts at Reliance Securities say their dealers' check indicates all-India average prices improved in March by about 1.6 per cent month-on-month, to Rs 311 a 50-kg bag. This has been led by moderate pick-up in demand in several pockets.\u201cThus, barring February, the average price trend remained up in January and March. Hence, average cement prices are up by four per cent sequentially in the March quarter,\u201d they add.Demand pick-up&#13;\nWhat\u2019s more, demand is expected to pick up. A key reason for subdued demand in the earlier quarter was lower offtake from government-related projects. That\u2019s also reflecting in the results of ACC, announced on Tuesday, which reported a 10 per cent year-on-year fall in volumes. A key reason is that the government curtailed spending to meet its fiscal deficit target for FY15. The new financial year should see a change in this trend.Analysts at Nomura expect cement demand growth to recover on higher government spending for infrastructure projects (higher allocations for roads and railways in the Union Budget). The pace of awarding road projects has tripled to 12 km/day in the past few months. In the channel checks of Nomura analysts, stockists and dealers sounded relatively more optimistic on volume growth in the coming months, particularly in the eastern region. They estimate cement volume growth of 7.8 per cent in FY16.Analysts are Karvy Stock Broking are also optimistic. They expect pan-India cement demand to grow at a compounded annual rate (CAGR) of 7.4 per cent over FY14-17, compared to 5.5 per cent CAGR in FY11-14. This, they believe, is on the back of expectations of a pick-up in demand from the housing and infrastructure segments, which account for around 60 per cent and 20 per cent of the total cement demand, respectively, in the country.&#13;\n\t&#13;\nBetter margins, earnings&#13;\nAs a result and due to slowing in capacity addition, utilisation is also expected to improve. Capacities that grew at 13.3 per cent CAGR during FY10-14 are expected to expand at 5.4 per cent CAGR during FY14-17. Hence, analysts at Karvy expect a gradual improvement in effective utilisation to 75 per cent by FY17 (from 71 per cent in FY14). This would further help improve realisation and margins of companies.However, utilisation in the south could lag, as most excess capacities are there. For now, pricing discipline has been maintained by companies in the south like India Cements, Ramco Cement, etc. In this backdrop, despite the relatively weaker demand scenario in the south, analysts expect companies based there to report strong numbers for the quarter ending March, largely led by realisations.Ahead&#13;\nAnalysts at a foreign brokerage believe secular upward utilisation rates is underway and see near-term weakness in stock prices as an opportunity to buy. They believe the worst is behind for the industry, on course for a gradual recovery after seven years of contraction in the capacity utilisation rate. Demand pick-up and rising entry barriers will steadily lift utilisation rates in the coming years, with resultant pricing power expanding margins and driving earnings.Their top picks include UltraTech, Grasim and ACC; they are also positive on Ambuja, Ramco and Shree Cement.In the near term, too, the outlook is looking better. Prices have already moved up across India in the March quarter. ACC\u2019s results suggest prices are up seven per cent.

On the occasion the release of his book, The Art of Wealth Creation, which compiles 19 annual wealth creation studies, Raamdeo Agrawal, joint managing director and co-founder of Motilal Oswal Financial Services, spoke to Vishal Chhabria on what it takes to make money in stocks, market valuations and earnings. Edited excerpts:Looking back at the wealth creation studies, what learning have you gathered?I started my wealth creation study 19 years ago, when I first heard about Warren Buffett. We\u2019ve started incorporating what I\u2019ve learnt from him and other books, in each and every study. In that process, two years ago, we figured that what works is QGLP \u2013 Quality (of business and management), Growth (in earnings), Longevity (of quality and growth) and Price (favourable purchase price of the stock). That\u2019s been the biggest learning, and can be applied to pick wealth creating stocks across industry, size of the company and time horizon. We have been practising it with the money we manage for people and that\u2019s the promise of Motilal Oswal Mutual Fund. Our portfolio is supposed to beat not only the benchmark but competition, too. That\u2019s been the experience in the past four to five years and the process will mature as we do more studies.&#13;\n\t\u00a0&#13;\n&#13;\n\tHow have you corrected the mistakes?&#13;\n&#13;\n\tWe realised 3-4 years back that 90-95% of the mistakes are committed and investors suffer because of the bad quality of companies in their portfolio. I was not that conscious about buying only quality businesses. I was willingly to buy anything if it was available cheap and there was growth potential. I used to have 200 companies in my portfolio; the last count was about 225 companies just before we started practicing wealth creation in 1995-96. We cleaned up and brought it down to 16 companies. With a very diversified unwieldy portfolio, you can\u2019t know enough about every company except for 5-10. You even don\u2019t remember the names.\u00a0&#13;\n&#13;\n\tI have reversed the process. Now first I understand the values and then go to the valuation. I will not compromise on quality and the QGL (quality, growth, longevity) I am looking for. Unless those three elements are there to my satisfaction I will not look at the valuation.&#13;\nIn view of the QGLP, if you look at the e-commerce space, the valuations are quite high. How do you go about navigating in that space?It\u2019s very simple. What (companies) I don\u2019t understand, I don\u2019t even go through the process. I don\u2019t know whether they (e-commerce companies) are going to make money or not. I am not in the game of speculating.But, then, won\u2019t you lose on the opportunity?It\u2019s doesn\u2019t matter. I need 15 stocks to manage a diversified portfolio and that\u2019s enough. In any case, there are not many online listed companies in India.&#13;\n\tYou have also been making investments in the unlisted space?&#13;\n&#13;\n\tYes, that\u2019s the private equity arm. There it is a different ball game but there also our specialisation is not on the tech side.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tBut there are quite a few of them, 3-4 that are going to go public this year itself. Like Parag Milk, Powermac from Hyderabad (the largest BTG installer in power plants) Creamica, the biscuit company from Ludhiana. There are 2-3 more companies which will go public in 2016-17. So, there are companies which are now maturing.&#13;\nAren\u2019t market valuations expensive?Currently, earnings are depressed. You have to adjust the broader market valuation to the cyclically depressed earnings. Today, earnings are about four per cent of the GDP. Historically, earnings range between three per cent and six-to-seven per cent. In the last bull run, it went up to as high as 7.5 per cent. As the economy picks up, it will go to six-to-eight per cent or even 10 per cent. FY16 will be the first year when actually earnings growth will be 15-16 per cent, which will be higher than the nominal GDP growth.For FY15, it didn\u2019t work out because of the inventory loss of OMCs (oil marketing companies), slowdown and other factors. Hence, earnings growth could turn out to be only five-six per cent. Even at 80 per cent of the GDP, market cap is cheap. At the peak, it was 1.8 times in 2007. So, as nominal GDP is growing at 12-13 per cent, my sense says in three to four years, it will be well above one-time. The stage is ready to get a broad market return of about 15 per cent compounded annual growth rate on a five-year basis. However, the shorter term will become more challenging. So, what you are saying is right; at current levels of earnings, markets are looking a little pricey. However, the overall market valuation is still not high from a longer term perspective.By when do you think the earnings will pick up?I think in the second half, after four-five months of the new Budget. Government expenditure is going to start now because it has got a new cheque book. The oil price is low and fuel prices have been de-controlled; so, subsidy, and current account and fiscal deficits are under control. The most important thing is the quality of government expenditure, which would be significantly better than the previous government\u2019s. That is going to make a huge difference, because if you spend say Rs 20 lakh crore in an economy and you get only worth say Rs 10 lakh crore worth of bang, and now if you spend Rs 20 lakh crore and you get Rs 15-17 lakh crore worth of bang, you will see the difference. You can see what is happening in spectrum auction, in coal auction, the pace at which they are clearing, is good. That means even parliament is working well. So, everybody is made to work more and someday the magic is going to happen, how can it not happen?What kind of earnings growth are you expecting for FY16 and thereafter?Earlier, we were much more bullish on earnings but it is getting revised every quarter. We\u2019re working on it so, for FY16, we might be still saying 12-15 per cent.&#13;\n\tAmong sectors, which are the ones you like and is it time to put some money on the infra and the cyclical sectors?&#13;\n&#13;\n\tWe will put money if it is a good business. I don't put in money in companies that have fancy names but not so fancy returns. Being a good business is more important than the name whether it is online, offline, infrastructure, non-infrastructure or consumer. If the companies don't make money I don't think we will make money. That is the fundamental thinking. We don't try to make money in the stock market, we try to make money in the businesses we own.&#13;\nWhat could be the possible near-term downside risks for markets?The market, in the short term, is always irrational. In the long-term, it is fairly rational, almost precise. In the short term, it can correct by 10-15 per cent, as it has risen so much. You might have monsoon failure, earnings disappointment for prolonged period, some political missteps by the current ruling government, some geo-political problems, spike in inflation, etc. So, problems can come from anywhere.&#13;\n\tIn last week\u2019s policy meet the RBI left almost everything unchanged. But with growth anaemic and government doing its bit to enhance growth and lower inflation, how do you read RBI\u2019s actions? And, isn\u2019t it impacting corporate India?&#13;\n&#13;\n\tThe governor\u2019s job is always very complex. He has to handle the forex balance, ensure exchange mechanism is working well, take care of the growth, etc and ensure there is an equilibrium. The RBI has cut rates twice by 25 basis points and the governor has time and again said that the long term trajectory is down. The pace of decline will depend on the data.\u00a0&#13;\n&#13;\n\tIf we wait too long for the fair rate to come, the rate to be become low, it will also take a lot of time for the rate to go up. Because then methodically all the inflationary forces would have been killed and then only you will get a sustained low inflation. It can work both ways. They (RBI and government) may be looking at setting the ground for a sustained low inflation, which can lead to very high quality, non-inflationary growth. Inflationary growth is not beneficial to the masses and the poor people. It only benefits few people, industrialists and larger set ups.&#13;\n\t\u00a0&#13;\nWhat is your view on the primary market in terms of initial public offering (IPO), qualified institutional placement (QIP) pipeline?The market is slowly reviving. It is still not robust but pipeline is building up and it still takes a lot of time to prepare for IPO. The timelines, somehow, should be further shortened.Regarding QIPs, they have started coming in. We have two or three of these. And, I think good quality companies are selling through properly. In QIP, you get listed companies which have some track record and research coverage.Our pipeline (for this year) is better than last year\u2019s. The market condition is also better. the secondary market has done quite well for the past four quarters and that will help some of these companies. However, the biggest seller in the quality IPO market will be private equity companies. Till about five years ago, PE was not so big. The companies that came out with IPOs were small. Today, PE players incubate the company allowing it to grow in size.For example, in our first fund we bought a stake in AU Financers for Rs 15-16 crore about 7-8 years back. Today, it must be a Rs 3,000 crore company.\u00a0&#13;\n\tHow is MOSL doing and what are the plans for each of them going ahead?&#13;\n&#13;\n\tWe have done well and the trend continues. The capital market business particularly in India is very cyclical. We are 60-70% broking, 15-20% in asset management and now we have started housing finance companies which has just completed a year.It is a full-fledged financial services company and very conservatively managed with a net cash balance sheet. But everything is linked to the market performance, including investments, which account for 30-40% of our balance sheet, are in the stock market through AMC products, etc. In last 12 months it has done well, so all our segments have also done well. As the market picks up, capital market activity picks up in broking, investing, private equity, public equity, I-banking, wealth management, we should do well. We are trying to build distribution all across India from Tier I to Tier II to Tier III and IV cities. We are in about 1,800 locations where we have the franchises in about 650 cities, and are going even deeper. We are also building up our online presence. Unlike in 2007 when broking was a large part, we have more businesses now.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tAre you looking to de-risk the business to some extent from markets, given the housing finance foray?\u00a0&#13;\n&#13;\n\tYes, but that is only one year old. So it will take some time before it has a meaningful impact on providing stability to the earnings. Right now 100% of the earnings are going up and down with the market. At the end of five years, we will have meaningful profits coming from housing finance which will give a lot more stability to the earnings. Fundamentally, if for next 5-10 years things work out the way we have designed, it will look very different and far more stable compared to last 5-10 years.", "newspaper": "Business Standard", "id": 163, "pubdate": "Wed, 15 Apr 2015 22:47:00 +0530", "title": "Stage set for 15% CAGR market returns over 5 years: Raamdeo Agrawal"}, {"content": "&#13;\n         &#13;\n    &#13;\nWith the reporting of earnings for the March 2015 quarter that started a few days ago, most analysts expect India Inc\u2019s performance in the three-month period to be dismal.

Against this backdrop and amid lack of fresh triggers, they expect the markets to play out accordingly.A recent report by Motilal Oswal, for instance, expects only five sectors to report double-digit profit after tax (PAT) growth, most of those in lower double digits. It predicts the telecom sector to grow 54 per cent (on a lower base), private banks (16 per cent), consumer goods (15 per cent), non-banking financial companies (10 per cent) and retail (10 per cent).Eight sectors are expected to report zero or negative PAT growth on a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis. These include utilities (-1 per cent), oil (ex-refining and marketing, -4 per cent), state-run banks (-5 per cent), real estate (-14 per cent), Cement (-14 per cent), capital goods (-17 per cent) and metals (-38 per cent).According to the report, more than half the Nifty constituents are likely to report de-growth or low single digit y-o-y PAT growth, thereby offsetting most of the contribution of high-growth companies. Top PAT de-growth companies will largely be global cyclical, such as Cairn India (-70 per cent), Tata Steel (-65 per cent), Bank of Baroda (-43 per cent), NMDC (-37 per cent), BHEL (-33 per cent), Hindalco (-33 per cent), Ambuja Cement (-28 per cent) and Tata Power (-28 per cent).Prabhat Awasthi, Nipun Prem and Sanjay Kadam of Nomura said in an India Equity Strategy report that they expected margin expansion to continue in the March 2015 quarter for automobiles and consumer goods (where pricing power still exists, on an average), telcos and power utilities.\u201cIn contrast, key sectors likely to report lower operating profit margins y-o-y are information technology services and pharma (adverse cross-currency effects), cement and project specialists in industrial and infrastructure space (sluggish execution and legacy low-margin orders),\u201d they said.Market outlook&#13;\nAre the markets factoring in such a dismal performance from corporate India? How are the markets likely to react to such numbers?Analysts believe the markets, to an extent, are factoring in a weak show by India Inc in the recently concluded quarter, and rule out a major fall, solely due to weak corporate earnings.\u201cThe markets are to an extent factoring in the negativity. However, there could still be a negative surprise. In case there are major negative surprises right at the beginning of the result season, the market will definitely lose steam,\u201d said Dalton Capital Advisors Managing Director U R Bhat.\u201cIn case of a fall/correction, the Nifty should find support at 8,600 (down 2.5 per cent from the current level of around 8,800), and then at 8,350 (down 5.3 per cent from the current level). It could slip below the 8,000 mark only on account of a major disappointment from the euro zone, especially Greece; this coincides with weak earnings,\u201d he adds.Analysts at Nomura also believe the markets have digested large parts of concern over growth weakness, following a correction in the BSE Bankex by 8 per cent \u2014 the index is down 16 per cent from the market\u2019s peak on January 29 2015 (Nifty is off its peak by 2 per cent).\u201cOur December-end Sensex target of 33,500 is based on around 14 per cent of earning growth forecast for 2015-16, less than the current consensus of around 17 per cent. We expect earnings growth to normalise to a higher level in the second half of FY16, as the commodity price base effect dissipates and \u2018catch-up\u2019 growth begins to manifest in earnings on the back of a sequential improvement in growth,\u201d the Nomura report says.", "newspaper": "Business Standard", "id": 164, "pubdate": "Wed, 15 Apr 2015 22:46:00 +0530", "title": "Are markets fully factoring in weak corporate earnings?"}, {"content": "&#13;\n         &#13;\n    The banking and financial sector could be due for a burst of speculation.

The latest inflation numbers show retail inflation is under control and could be trending down.The banking and financial sector could be due for a burst of speculation. At the policy review on April 7, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) held policy rates and Cash Reserve Ratio steady. The Governor, Raghuram Rajan, said he wanted banks to cut commercial rates. The latest inflation numbers show retail inflation is under control and could be trending down.So, banks could hope for another policy rate cut. But they must cut rates first. State Bank of India (SBI) and ICICI Bank have already cut rates by token amounts. Credit offtake has also been very low across the sector. Non-food credit growth is at 20-year-lows, at just about 10 per cent growth. Rate cuts could drive credit volumes.The fundamentals are hard to judge. We could soon get some sense of trends as Q4 results come in. Banking has been hit hard by years of growth recession, rising sticky debts and record restructurings. Balance sheets are not in great shape, with close to 10 per cent of total assets being impaired.Share prices are at interesting levels. If the SBI and ICICI cuts are emulated by other banks, there could be positive sentiment. On the other hand, poor Q4 numbers could lead to hammering. The Bank Nifty index is high-beta and highly correlated to the Nifty. In the last two weeks, the Nifty (up three per cent since April 1) has slightly outperformed the Bank Nifty (up 2.8 per cent in April). This situation is unlikely to hold for long. The Bank Nifty will either overtake the Nifty or banking will pull the Nifty down if it goes negative, since banks contribute a big weight.The Bank Nifty has hit resistance at 19,000 levels and found support at 18,500. Breakouts beyond either 19,000 or 18,500 could give the index a clear run till at 19,500 or higher or pull it down till 18,000 or lower.The Bank Nifty often sees two per cent (350-400 points) spread between high and low in a given session. When it trends, it can climb or drop 1.5- two per cent (300-400 points). This means a move till 19,500 or till 18,000 could be only two or three trending sessions away.If you have a view, there are many ways to create long or short positions. The aggressive trader can focus on high-beta bank stock futures. The less aggressive trader could go long or short in the Bank Nifty futures, with a trailing stop-loss.A hedger who uses options may go long (or short) in the futures and buy a put (or buy a call). The trader with a view might also take a bullspread with long 19,000c (194), short 19,500c (68). This costs 126 and it could pay a maximum of 374 on an uptrend. Or, he may take a bearspread of long 18,500p (225), short 18,000p (100). This costs 125 and could pay a maximum of 375 on a downtrend.The hedger who is playing for a breakout in either direction might combine both positions. That is, a long strangle of long 18,500p (225) and long 19,000c (194), offset with a short strangle of short 18,000p (100), short 19,500c (68). This costs 251, and it could pay maximum of 249 (neglecting brokerage). An even money risk:reward ratio is not very attractive however, since there might not be a breakout.My inclination would be to take a long 18,000p (100) and a long 19,500c (68). If there is a breakout, this wide strangle will pay handsomely.

In a new report, the IMF says that countries that export oil and other commodities have been severely affected.Some emerging economies have been hit by sharp moves in the global currency markets.And the report says financial stability is still not \"fully grounded\" in the rich countries.\"Risks to the global financial system have risen since October and have rotated to parts of the financial system where they are harder to assess and harder to address,\" said Jose Vinals, financial counsellor at the IMF.The IMF acknowledges that recent declines in the prices of oil and other commodities are on balance helpful for global economic prospects. But they create a major challenge for countries and firms that export them.It says the strains in debt repayment capacity are apparent for oil and gas businesses in Argentina, Brazil, South Africa and Nigeria.  Debt servicing is also a concern for governments reliant on oil revenues such as Nigeria and Venezuela. Many other major oil exporters have sufficient reserves to enable them to cope with lower prices for some time. Other developing nations, those that import commodities, do however benefit from these lower prices Movements in the currency markets have also hit some emerging countries. The rise in the value of the dollar increases the repayment burden for firms and governments that have borrowed in the US currency. Some have also faced significant outflows of capital.Interest rate hike fearsThere is also a warning that there could be more of that when the US Federal Reserve starts to raise interest rates, which is expected later this year.  It might happen smoothly, but the report says there is a danger that it might spark more volatility.The report also says that there's a danger of property price declines in some countries, especially in China, which could spill over to emerging countries more widely. In the rich countries very low interest rates - welcomed by the IMF for their economic benefits - do nonetheless pose some financial issues. Some European life insurers could struggle and low rates are reflected in more financial risk taking as investors seek better returns.Some elements of this picture of rising risks reflects the aftermath of the financial crisis. The low interest rates in the rich countries, for example are part of the response to the economic damage, but they do create new risks. The rising dollar is, indirectly, the result of the more rapid post-crisis rebound in the US compared with continental Europe.  Six-and-a-half years on from the most intense phase of the crisis, its long shadow remains. Still, the IMF does see some more encouraging developments. In particular economic growth is expected to be slightly higher this year and next, which would tend to promote financial stability. \n    ", "newspaper": "BBC", "id": 190, "pubdate": "Wed, 15 Apr 2015 18:30:13 +0530", "title": "Global financial risks 'have risen'"}, {"content": "\n                        Men still have significantly more financial access than women in South Asia\n                    \n                More than a quarter of people globally still do not have access to banking facilities, a report shows.The World Bank's Global Findex report said more than half of adults in the world's poorest areas still have no access to the financial system.This is despite a global increase of 11% in the last three years of adults owning bank accounts.The increase in account ownership has been driven largely by developing countries and the role of technology.\n                        Technology contributes to increased financial access in Sub-Saharan Africa\n                    \n                Mobile moneyBroader access to the financial system can \"boost job creation, increase investment in education\" and is \"critical to ending global poverty\", said the report.It also found that the gender gap in financial inclusion is not narrowing.

Just use the word Uber and you can guarantee the air will turn blue with complaints about unfair competition and the failure of Transport for London to sort it out. But now the controversial Californian car service is facing new competition from an app which the black cab drivers won't be bad mouthing.That's because Maaxi's strategy is all about giving taxi drivers a better chance of competing with Uber. Its key idea is to use its technology to let customers share a black cab. I shared a ride with the firm's chief executive Gabi Campos and he explained that customers could potentially pay even less than Uber charges. \"If you get four people in a cab that can get you close to the rate people pay for public transport,\" he said.  And he thinks Maaxi will really come into its own during busy periods when Uber's surge pricing takes its fares higher. \"Maaxi will decrease prices then because the number of people going in the same direction is quite high and, therefore, we can get people a ride for a quarter of the price on a black cab meter, whereas Uber will charge more than a cab.\"The trouble is Maaxi will depend for its success on a triple network effect - it needs enough drivers, enough customers and enough people all heading in the same direction and wanting to share a cab.  It sounds to me as if it may struggle on all three counts.We first reported on Maaxi last October when it was apparently on the verge of launching. It seemed to be well-funded, with generous backing from its co-founder Nat Rothschild and it had the political muscle of the Licensed Taxi Drivers Association behind it. Then nothing happened for a long time.Explaining the delays, Gabi Campos talks about the technology. \"It was a matter of getting it right, making it effortless for the customer.\" But even after six months of marketing to the taxi trade by their own association, only around 10% of London's 25,000 cab drivers have signed up.\n                        Maaxi uses GPS location tech to direct taxis to passengers using the app\n                    \n                That makes it a much smaller force than Hailo, which fell out with cabbies last year when it said it would offer minicabs as well as taxis, but seems to be winning some of them back. And if Maaxi's cab-sharing concept is slow to get going - or simply doesn't appeal to taxi customers - then it will offer the same product as Hailo with fewer cabs on the road. Meanwhile, there's yet more competition in the form of another app Splyt, which aims to get minicab customers sharing a ride. It's launched this week with a 99p a ride offer and its founder Phillipp Mintchin admits it needs to get a lot of customers on board fast if the idea is to work. \"What we intend to do this week,\" he told me \"is to get the Splyt app on everyone's phone.\"  He also needs lots of drivers, and when I visited the Splyt office, plenty were queuing to sign up, collecting a tablet computer to help them in the complex process of organising shared rides.For both Maaxi and Splyt, the question is whether they can make any kind of impact on Uber, the global giant of rides-by-app. Jo Bertram, who runs Uber in the UK, seemed relaxed about the new competition when I met her in the London offices which the firm is about to outgrow. She claimed that growth was actually accelerating.  \"Competition is good for the consumer and good for the driver,\" she said.What is clear is that Uber has driven a big increase in the number of minicabs on the road. The regulator TFL says there are more than 77,000 licensed private hire drivers in London now, up from 52,000 last year. But are they happy in their work? A glance at an Uber drivers' forum shows quite a few complaints about how hard it is to make a decent living when supply of cars exceeds demand.And when we chatted to Orhan, a driver who once worked with Uber and is now with Splyt, we got a very negative picture. \"It's a disaster for everyone - income for drivers has gone downhill like crazy. Whether it's a minicab driver, black cab driver, Splyt driver, Uber driver, it's very bad news.\"Now, other drivers we met in a day using London's various taxi apps seemed happy enough with their lot. But the disruptive impact of new technology is transforming the way we get around cities, and while that provides more choice for consumers, not everyone is convinced it is improving our lives.\n    ", "newspaper": "BBC", "id": 202, "pubdate": "Wed, 15 Apr 2015 13:14:45 +0530", "title": "Maaxi - will we care for sharing?"}, {"content": "", "newspaper": "BBC", "id": 203, "pubdate": "Wed, 15 Apr 2015 19:23:52 +0530", "title": "VIDEO: Protester jumps on Draghi desk"}, {"content": "A push by labour activists in the United States for a $15 per hour minimum wage is going global.

But a combination of forces is squeezing carbon assets like never before.The oil price remains stubbornly low. Renewables are becoming more affordable and moving into the mainstream. On top of that, some investment managers are now beginning to question the value of their holdings in carbon fuels as the pressure builds for the world to limit climate change by reducing carbon emissions. Some observers believe energy is at a potential tipping point.Much of the pressure was initially triggered by a man in a small office in central London \u2013 a man with a question.Mark Campanale, a former City investment manager, mused: how much of the reserves of oil and gas written in the reserve books of the world's energy giants could we actually go ahead and burn in our cars and our power stations while sticking to the promises governments were making on limiting climate change?He found to his surprise that no-one had done the sums. The research he commissioned showed that energy companies have already found more coal, oil and gas than we can burn if politicians keep their promise to hold the global temperature rise below 2C. The report produced a shock-wave. Academics from University College London finessed the findings, warning that we must not burn 80% of our coal, 55% of our gas, and 30% of our oil if we want to meet agreed targets on carbon emissions.Meanwhile, a pressure group, 350.org, began urging faith organisations, foundations and pension funds to withdraw funds from fossil fuels, arguing it is morally wrong to put your money in carbon fuels. So far, more than 220 institutions have taken the decision to divest.These include the heirs to the Rockefeller Standard Oil fortune and the board of trustees at California's Stanford University. This week students at Harvard are calling on that university to follow suit. Even the Bank of England has joined the fray. It\u2019s investigating whether fossil fuel stocks could cause a destabilising \"carbon bubble\" in financial markets.\n                        Students at Harvard are calling on the university to pull its funds out of fossil fuels\n                    \n                So far, the divestors are a drop in the ocean. The great majority of investment managers are sticking with oil stocks. They acknowledge the climate-related risks but believe that with growing demand, particularly in developing countries, the future of oil and gas will be rosy for decades.A third group of investors is taking a different strategy \u2013 keeping their money in fossil fuel stocks, but raising uncomfortable questions at company AGMs.Saker Nusseibeh, chief executive of Hermes fund managers, is one these. He told me that concern in the City over the climate to fossil fuels is still small \u2013 but growing.\u201cI think 10 years ago it was consigned to people much more concerned by environmental issues \u2013 tree huggers, if you like,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that people are thinking about it in the mainstream is quite new. And I think that the regulator thinks of it as a source of risk for the City of London is particularly interesting \u2013 and new.\u201dBP and Shell have both agreed to support shareholder motions mandating more transparency over the risks to their fossil fuel assets from climate policies. But both maintain the future will offer a version of business as usual.\n                        We still rely heavily on fossil fuels\n                    \n                In a statement, BP said: \u201cAffordable, secure and sustainable energy is essential for economic prosperity. We expect energy demand to grow by nearly 40% - driven by the developing world. To meet this demand a diverse mix of energy sources will be needed \u2013 including fossil fuels.\u201dShell concurs: \u201cShell has already been increasing transparency and engagement on emissions and climate change; we need a balanced debate, global thinking and effective forward looking policy and regulation that can deliver more energy for less carbon.\u201d    But while the industry is paying attention to the questions being raised, one industry source told me the oil giants simply don\u2019t expect governments to keep their promises to cut carbon emissions. They plan, the source told me, to keep seeking more fuels in the expectation that they will get burned.And so far the price of borrowing and the price of shares for oil industry majors also reflects that expectation: that energy companies will be able to sell their reserves for the foreseeable future. But oil bosses are becoming more vocal, speaking up on behalf of their industry. Shell\u2019s CEO recently condemned what he said were naive voices calling for rapid decarbonisation of the global economy.\"With an exceptional effort, as much as 25% of the world's energy could come from renewables by 2050,\" said Ben van Beurden. \"But non-renewable forms of energy will have to make up the rest.\"The UK's former climate change ambassador John Ashton has condemned his comments.

Some five years previously - in 2005 - the Glazer family had taken over the Old Trafford club, in a controversial, highly-leveraged, buyout, which alienated a large chunk of its support and a mainly sceptical Fleet Street too.And some of those fans were not - and are still not - prepared to let the secretive US owners forget their anger at the hundreds of millions of pounds of debt that the takeover put on the Old Trafford club.'Measured'\"From an American perspective - where they have passionate sports fans of their own - it was still a shock for Joel Glazer to hear chants at the AC Milan game like 'Die Glazer die'. That was extraordinary,\" recalls Tehsin Nayani, who worked for six years as confidential media advisor for the Glazers.\n                        Man Utd players Juan Mata and Ashley Young celebrate a goal\n                    \n                Nayani, a former business journalist now PR executive, first began working on Glazer media matters in 2004.And, although he would become immersed in the extraordinary trappings which accompanied being part of the club - particularly the luxury which surrounded the players, he would draw up his Glazers media strategy from the humbler surrounds of a terraced house in Norwich. As he explains in his new book to coincide with the tenth anniversary of their takeover; while ageing family patriarch Malcolm was the figurehead for the owners, day-to-day running of the club was in the hands of his sons, headed by Joel.\n                        The green-and-gold protest saw fans wear the colours of pre-Man Utd club, Newton Heath\n                    \n                \"A phrase that I repeatedly use, is to describe Joel Glazer as measured.  I have dealt with hundreds of business leaders in my career,  and he was constantly calm and assured under pressure,\" he says.Indeed, so unassuming seemed the brothers that he dubbed them \"middle-class billionaires\" who would \"not have looked out of place at a chartered accountants' convention\".'Busted flush?'His introduction to the wealthy family from Rochester, New York, came in the feverish atmosphere of late 2004. Following one failed Manchester United takeover the Glazers and their advisors hatched Project Hampstead, a fresh strategy to win control.\"The Glazers were already controversial characters, having been perceived to have failed in their bid for Manchester United in 2004,\" recalls Nayani.\n                        Nayani says Manchester United is a UK cultural icon\n                    \n                \"When I came on board, the question I asked myself was whether they were already a busted flush.  However, I quickly realised that with [bank] Rothschild on board to advise, they were very much poised to buy Manchester United.\"He says that because the Glazers were already Manchester United shareholders, holding 29% of shares, stock market rules meant they were unable to provide a commentary on their intentions, to the frustration of fans and the media.Their breakthrough came when the Americans realised the Cubic Expression investment business, owned by Irish racing tycoons John Magnier and JP McManus, would be willing to sell its 28.7% stake at the right price, probably 300p a share. 'Tense time'\"One thing the 2004 club AGM had smoked out was that the Irish duo would be unlikely to support the board, but it was always an unknown about whether they would be willing to sell their shares,\" says Nayani.As it turned out they were, and he recalls the fevered activity of 11 and 12 May 2005, and the transfer of \u00a3235m to the Irish pair for their shares.  But - with all negotiations done through third parties -  he says there was a constant fear right to completion, that the transaction may not go ahead.\n                        Irish racehorse owner JP McManus and partner John Magnier held a major block of shares\n                    \n                Once they acquired the Irish stake the Glazers held the majority of club shares and were de facto Manchester United owners, (although it would be roughly another month before they acquired the rest of the shares).\"It was an incredibly tense time,\" recalls Nayani.  When it became obvious that the Glazers were taking control \"there was a lot of incredulity, this was Manchester United - a UK cultural icon\".'Growing revenues'Once ownership was secure, his intention was to go on the \"front foot\", and explain who the Glazers were, including their \"passion for sport\" as exemplified by their ownership of NFL team the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n                        An anti-Glazer protest shortly after the 2005 takeover\n                    \n                \"They had a very strong sports pedigree, were already shareholders, and saw Manchester United as the sporting jewel in the crown,\" says Nayani. \"They were also very ambitious.  They wanted to utilise their expertise as part of their ownership of the club.\"But - in the wake of fan protests - almost immediately Nayani found his time was being used to mitigate the Glazer's leveraged - or indebted - business model.  An analogy he uses is to compare the Glazer's club ownership to a household mortgage.\"Many people have a mortgage on their homes. Provided they have a steady income that can comfortably cover the interest payments it's not an issue,\" says Nayani, adding that Man United was also an appreciating asset.\n                        The Champions League trophy was won in Moscow in 2008\n                    \n                \"Moreover, the Glazers set about significantly growing revenues via commercial deals, making the debt even more manageable.\" he says, while also pointing to ever-growing Premier League TV deals.In addition, he says during his time at the centre of Manchester United events, manager Sir Alex Ferguson was always assured of having cash to invest in the team.'Marathon not a sprint'However, fan groups would continue to highlight the debt issue, believing that large interest payments being made to service the debt could be better used to invest in players. Also, bar one interview by Joel with Manchester United's own TV channel, the family,  which Nayani says \"highly prizes its privacy\" did not interact with the UK media, causing much frustration.\n                        Nayani says it seems the Glazers are looking to long-term ownership of the club\n                    \n                Matters came to a head in the first half of 2010, with the green-and-gold fan protest and the Red Knights emergence.  However, Nayani says by June that year both had largely blown over.\"Looking back, things seemed high octane, but the reality was more prosaic, more mundane,\" he says. \"Joel Glazer assured me many times during this period that the club was definitely not for sale. \"His mantra was always 'business of usual' - and although the club was pipped by Chelsea to the 2010 title - the show went on.\"With the successful completion of a club bond issue in 2010, and after six years, Nayani felt the time was right to end his Glazer connection.After a period when the club won a Champions League, three Premier Leagues, and two League Cups, he was given a payoff from the Glazers. \"I know my book The Glazer Gatekeeper will be unlikely to assuage those who have reservations about their ownership of Manchester United,\" says Nayani.  He adds: \"It is five years since I was working for the Glazer family, but I am always minded of Joel's aphorism, 'it is a marathon not a sprint'. I can only estimate we are very much in the early laps of their long-term ownership.\"\n    ", "newspaper": "BBC", "id": 212, "pubdate": "Thu, 16 Apr 2015 04:34:26 +0530", "title": "Working for Man Utd's billionaire owners"}, {"content": "\n                        Striders Edge has expanded from the UK to the American market\n                    \n                The days when women would simply throw on an old t-shirt to do some exercise are long gone.Instead, in today's ever more fitness and fashion conscious world, a growing number are willing to pay as much for a new gym outfit as they do for a new formal party dress.This has led to a big increase over recent years in the value of the women's sportswear market.In the US alone, combined sales of such products - from yoga leggings, sports bras and vests, to tracksuits - totalled $15.1bn (\u00a310.3bn) in the 12 months to August 2011, according to research firm NPD Group.

Morris and the followers of the Arts and Crafts movement, which spanned Britain, the United States and Japan in the late 19th century, argued that mass manufactured products devalued labour and led to cheap and ugly surroundings.It's not too big a stretch to argue that the 21st century version of that argument is \"buy good things from real people\" - the motto of online crafts marketplace Etsy.Founded a decade ago in Brooklyn, New York - the epicentre of the do-it-yourself (DIY) movement - Etsy is billed as the \"artisanal\" eBay, a place where crafters can sell their wares to like-minded buyers.The site has capitalised on a generational shift, where younger consumers value knowing where and how their purchases are made - and are willing to spend more for that knowledge.

It will now be all about the shareholders and how much money they can make for them and no one else,\" wrote one seller of vintage jewellery.Many users said they viewed the decision to go public as part of a larger trend away from the company's small DIY ethos - particularly after Etsy decided to amend its rules to allow sellers to let outside manufacturers make their goods.But Lisa Yen, who runs the Etsy shop Moss+Twig from her one-bedroom apartment in Flatbush, Brooklyn, where she makes terrariums filled with moss and whimsical accoutrements such as coral and figurines that cost between $26 and $75, says she is optimistic.\n                        Lisa Yen started her Etsy, Moss &amp; Twig, store nearly two years ago\n                    \n                \"I think actually once they start offering shares the company will start growing [and] it will just expand the programmes they can offer their sellers,\" says Ms Yen, who has benefitted from Etsy programmes that link sellers with large retailers such as Nordstrom.\"There's still a lot of people who don't know what Etsy is, so it's going to get a lot of traction and I can only see good coming out of this.\"\n                        Ms Yen makes moss terariums, which she sells for between $26 and $75 a piece\n                    \n                \n                        Ms Yen says she sells about $1,000 worth of goods a month on Etsy\n                    \n                Don't forgetWhile there is nothing illegal in prioritising social good over profits, according to Brooklyn Law School professor Dana Brakman Reiser, the problem for Etsy is that there are very few other firms who have signed on to the B corporation platform that have also attempted to appeal to outside investors.\"Etsy is going to have to be persuasive to a much larger and more diverse group of shareholders now,\" says Prof Brakman Reiser.\"Many people think is going to scare investors off, who think 'why would I invest in a company that's going to trade my profits for social good? I'll just get the profits and buy my own social good by making a donation?'.\"The challenge for Etsy will be to maintain a high enough share price and a sufficiently diverse investor base who will see value in the company's more expensive decisions. If it fails to do so, the company could become a target for a takeover by a larger rival such as eBay.What is a B Corp?Created in 2006 by the non-profit B Labs, a B Corporation (or B Corp) is one that has audited itself to evaluate its performance on a series of metrics including the company's commitment to sustainability and diversity. If the firm gets a score above 80 (out of a possible 200) it can call itself a B Corp and advertise its commitment to social good. The label is like those given to organic or Fairtrade food - a private certification \"intended to demonstrate that this is a company that is using its business to also achieve some kind of social good\", according to Prof Brakman Reiser.B Corps are different, although related, to Benefit Corporations, which are legal entities. Some, but not all, US states allow companies to register as Benefit Corporations, which is a legal category different than that of a Limited Liability Corporation (LLC), for instance.Etsy, which is registered in the US state of Delaware, is technically supposed to register as a Benefit Corporation as part of its adherence to the B Corp programme, which it has not yet done. DIY IPOThat is why Prof Brakman Reiser and others have said that Etsy is making a canny move in prioritising its sellers - and other smaller investors - in its public share sale.Unlike the public stock offerings of other technology companies such as Facebook or Twitter, in which smaller investors were largely excluded from buying shares ahead of the listing, Etsy has specifically advertised its offering to the sellers on its site.The company has set aside 5% of its shares to allow smaller investors to purchase between $100 and $2,500 worth of Etsy stock. Kenneth Manger, who runs a new Etsy store, printswonderful, is one of the hopeful buyers.\"I was surprised when I clicked on the little IPO thing that they had on the website that they actually would make shares available to small investors,\" he says.\n                        Kenneth Manger runs an Etsy store called printswonderful\n                    \n                He says that while he cannot claim to be an Etsy expert, he appreciates the company's commitment to creativity. That is why he is willing to take a risk investing in a company that is yet to turn a profit.If Etsy is successful - and success, in this instance, will be more than just whether shares in the firm \"pop\", or rise significantly in their first day of trading, which is expected to be Thursday - it could serve as a model for other like-minded firms.\"If Etsy demonstrates continued growth stable or rising share price and a lot of liquidity for investors, that's proof of concept that this kind of company can get funding on the public markets,\" says Prof Brakman Reiser.\n    ", "newspaper": "BBC", "id": 214, "pubdate": "Wed, 15 Apr 2015 04:34:22 +0530", "title": "Can craft and capitalism coexist?"}, {"content": "\n                        Lovlu Mia from Bangladesh couldn't cook when he first arrived in Singapore 12 years ago\n                    \n                At Singapore's largest dormitory for foreign workers, Lovlu Mia is cooking chapatis over a hot flame in a giant kitchen. The 36 year-old Bangladeshi works on construction sites, earning $720 (\u00a3492) a month and he sends most of it to his wife and five-year-old son back home. He is one of thousands of migrant workers housed at the Tuas View Dormitory - a huge new complex in Singapore's industrial far west.In the past, foreign workers' accommodation has been the subject of criticism from human rights groups. So Tuas View, with beds for 16,800 men and medical and shopping facilities, is being hailed as the ideal model for housing them. It's like a small town, with a mini-market, a food court, a medical clinic and a dentist.Employers pay the bills - $220 per month for a bed and a locker. The workers' laundry and cleaning are done for them.There's also a well-equipped gym and a cricket pitch. At night the men watch the latest Bollywood movies on a large outdoor screen. There's even a view of the sea. But for the residents there is a trade-off. While they enjoy better facilities here, they give up some privacy.Each time they arrive home, workers are required to give their fingerprints. Almost 250 CCTV cameras monitor them.\"If the company is saying to us: 'What time did he come in? What time did he go out? Because he's not been coming to work, he's disappearing', we can give them a record,\" says Mr V Ranjan, the dormitory's camp manager.Surveillance also means that if a crime were to occur, dormitory authorities could supply information to police, he adds. \n                        Workers are finger-printed upon entry and exit\n                    \n                \n                        Nearly 250 CCTV cameras are onsite to monitor the residents at the dormitory\n                    \n                Some argue the plan is partly motivated by a desire to separate these workers from mainstream society. In 2013 a rare migrant worker riot broke out in the city's Little India district. Police cars were burned and officers attacked.Jolovan Wham, from Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics (HOME), says he believes the thinking behind the big out-of town dormitories is \"to keep [migrant workers] out of the mainstream as much as possible\u2026 so outbreaks of violence will be less likely to happen or, if they do, it will be easier to contain\". Mr R Subra, a consultant at Tuas View, has been in the business of housing such workers for two decades. He says the construction of new super-dorms like his are not linked to the riot, but the result of long-term government planning aimed at improving their lot.\n                        The dormitory has a grocery shop on site\n                    \n                But, he adds, if those workers are provided with enough on-site facilities, then aside from going to work, they won't need to venture out much into the wider community.\"When they go into the neighbourhood, maybe certain Singaporeans will not welcome them,\" he said. \"So we are trying to keep these people as much as possible in the dormitory complex so they will be happy.\"Far from the cityResidents of Tuas View come from countries including India, Bangladesh, China, Myanmar, Thailand and the Philippines. They work in blue-collar industries like construction, shipping, oil and gas, and pharmaceuticals. The workers, who sleep 12 to a room, are free to come and go as they please. But the dorm is about as far from the city centre as you can get. Tuas View DormitorySingapore's biggest dormitory with 20 four-storey blocks\nThe complex can accommodate up to 16,800 residents\nThe first integrated facility built for foreign workers\nAmenities include a minimart, a beer garden and a 250-seat cinema\n\"Here the air is very fresh,\" says Gogo Perez, a father of three from the Philippines. \"And if you want to exercise you have a lot of places, a gym and a basketball court.\" It's very different to how many of Singapore's migrant workers live. They are spread throughout the city, in accommodation ranging from temporary set-ups on construction sites, to crowded rooms above shops.The BBC was given a video of a dormitory attached to a factory - a narrow, cramped room full of rudimentary bunk beds, with no mattresses, just wooden boards. We were told 25 people were living in it.More photos of other dorms provided by the workers' advocacy group Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2) revealed similarly crowded and unsanitary conditions.But despite its advantages the dormitory at Tuas View is still less than half full. Many employers are resisting accommodating their workers in such facilities, because other places are cheaper.\n                        Employers cover the accommodation costs at the dormitory\n                    \n                Workers' advocates say the lack of privacy is not something migrant workers complain about. They have come to expect close scrutiny.In fact TWC2's Debbie Fordyce says foreign workers rarely complain about anything, as long as they're getting paid.Last year Singapore introduced legislation regulating living conditions in large-scale accommodation. A spokesperson from the Ministry of Manpower says the needs of foreign workers are better met through purpose-built dormitories with adequate living space and recreational facilities. And it says these are generally located no more than about 25 kilometres from the city centre. Debbie Fordyce says she's all in favour of the government improving workers' accommodation but still has reservations about how it's being done. \"We hear the government talking about having a better relationship with foreign workers, but we see them housed in these far off places and it looks like a type of apartheid.\"\n    ", "newspaper": "BBC", "id": 215, "pubdate": "Wed, 15 Apr 2015 01:50:09 +0530", "title": "Keeping an eye on migrant workers"}, {"content": "\n                        Finland was seen as an education superpower after its success in international tests\n                    \n                No international education conference is complete without a reference to Finland.Ever since it appeared at the top of international league tables more than a decade ago, it has been endlessly hailed as how to run an education system.Finland, which faces a general election this week, has been the poster child for education reform and overseas delegations have made pilgrimages to learn from its example.In particular it has been used to argue that you can have high results without an overbearing system of testing and inspection.It was the country where pupils did not have to start school until they were seven, enjoyed the longest holidays and then basked in the glow of global approval when they topped the tables in the international Pisa tests.But is the gloss coming off the image of Finland as an education superpower?More like an Asian tigerA study from Gabriel Heller Sahlgren, director of research at the Centre for Market Reform of Education, argues that Finland's education standards are in decline.He says it is a misunderstanding of Finland's success to attribute it to a liberal culture without league tables or a formal curriculum and giving much autonomy to teachers.\n                        Finland faces a general election this week\n                    \n                In a report published by the right-wing think tank the Centre for Policy Studies, Mr Sahlgren argues that Finland's star performance in the 2000 Pisa tests was built on the legacy of an older, very traditional education system, which had been part of the country's process of nation building.But this wasn't the image of Finland wanted by education experts, he says. Instead, when Finland was the top performer in Europe, it was used as a \"counter-argument\" to the success of east Asian school systems in Singapore, Shanghai and Hong Kong.More stories from the BBC's Knowledge economy series looking at education from a global perspective and how to get in touchWhile they were seen as successful because of hard work and grindingly long hours, Finland was seen as the way to achieve success with a much more creative and less centralised approach.Mr Sahlgren, based at the London School of Economics, says there was \"never any real evidence\" for such an impression. \"It was simplistic, looking at how Finland's system looked today, without looking at its history.\"\n                        Finland's school system became part of its building of a national identity\n                    \n                Rather than being the opposite of east Asian countries, he says in many ways Finland was like those emerging economies. Compared with its Nordic neighbours, Finland was a \"late developer\", much poorer and with lower levels of education in the early part of the 20th Century.Finland's approach of investing heavily in education and seeing rapid improvements was in many ways more like the pattern of Tiger economies in east Asia than the more sluggish progress in western Europe.'Fairy stories'Mr Sahlgren's research argues there is a reluctance to accept that Finland's education system, under which many of its successful teachers had trained, had been very structured and centralised.\n                        Finland has been the European country that matched East Asian countries in education tests\n                    \n                He quotes a research group from the UK visiting schools in Finland in 1996, a few years before the Pisa tests brought the world's attention to the country's schools.\"We have moved from school to school and seen almost identical lessons, you could have swapped the teachers over and the children would never have noticed the difference,\" said the researchers from the University of East Anglia, observing Finnish classrooms.Another study challenges what it calls the \"misconceptions and misrepresentations\" about Finland's success in the Pisa tests.Tim Oates, director of assessment research for the Cambridge Assessment exam group, has published a study called \"Finnish fairy stories\", in which he debunks what he claims are myths about the Finnish system.'Education tourism'He says the waves of \"education tourism\" that followed the success in Pisa tests failed to look at how the system had improved.\n                        How much of Finland's success was the legacy of an earlier, more traditional school system?\n                    \n                \"They got off the plane and asked the Finns about the system in 2000 - not what it was like during the 1970s and 1980s, when standards were rising.\"He also warns of a tendency for people to use Finland's school system as a way of confirming what they want to find.The claim that Finland does not have an Ofsted-style inspection and national testing is an incomplete picture, says Mr Oates. He says there has been a strong system of accountability and inspection and gathering of data.The difference from a system such as England, says Mr Oates, is how the information is used - for example in Finland exam results are not published in school league tables as they are in England.

And Mr Sahlgren warns of a school system in decline. It is no longer in the top 10 for maths in Pisa tests, having been in second place in 2003 and 2006.Andreas Schleicher, the OECD's director of education and the creator of the Pisa tests, rejects this analysis.\"In the 1960s, Finland was an average performer at best and that was when it had a very traditional education system,\" says Mr Schleicher. \"Finland changed its system only in the late 1970s and 1980s and that's when we saw the results rise. The most recent decline is quite modest,\" he said.Mr Oates says the problem has been that people have used Finland as a way of discussing their own national education debates, without really thinking about what made Finland different.\"People have been seriously misled by stories told by people who have looked at Finland through their own, restricted lens,\" he says.\n    ", "newspaper": "BBC", "id": 216, "pubdate": "Wed, 15 Apr 2015 04:40:26 +0530", "title": "Finns aren't what they used to be"}, {"content": " NEW DELHI: Toll management company MEP Infrastructure Developers' Rs 324 crore initial public offer (IPO) will hit the capital markets on April 21.

We are seeing an element of safe-haven flows, with German Bunds yields falling and Greek yields rising,\" said Jeremy Stretch, head of currency strategy at CIBC World Markets. \"That will cap any bounce in the euro and although political risks surround the pound, euro/sterling, we think, will head lower,\" added Stretch. Sterling was also helped by good data. Figures released overnight showed British house prices grew at their fastest pace in five months. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors' monthly house price balance rose to +21 in March, above all forecasts in a Reuters poll, from +15 in February. The data offered another sign that a cooling in the housing market in the UK may be ending and demand was holding up despite uncertainty arising from Brtain's election on May 7. Most polls show the Conservatives and the Labour Party neck and neck, meaning a hung parliament is likely. A strong showing by smaller parties like the Scottish Nationalists also makes it hard to predict who will win and whether a stable government can be formed. \"Tonight sees another election TV debate and continuing polls pointing to a hung parliament suggests the political risk premium in sterling has room to grow,\" said Chris Turner, head of currency strategy at ING.

The bank has been selling retail operations in a number of countries, shrinking its U.S. branch network and getting rid of non-core businesses.Citi's operating expenses fell 10 percent to $10.88 billion in the first quarter ended March 31 as it spent less on employee compensation and advertising and marketing.Legal and restructuring costs plunged to $403 million from $1.16 billion. Shares of the third biggest U.S. bank by assets rose 1.5 percent to $54 in early trading on Thursday. Revenue from investment banking, which is part of Citi's institutional clients group, rose 14 percent to about $1.20 billion. However, overall revenue in the institutional clients group fell 1 percent to $9.03 billion, dragged down by fixed income trading.

There are expectations that growth will rebound in the second quarter, but the tepid housing starts report and a struggling manufacturing sector suggest the momentum will probably not be strong enough for the Federal Reserve to start raising interest rates before September.Groundbreaking increased 2.0 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 926,000 units, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. That left the bulk of February's decline, which had been blamed on bad weather, intact.Starts for single-family homes rose, while groundbreaking for the multifamily segment fell last month. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast groundbreaking rising to a 1.04 million-unit pace in March. Permits for future home construction declined 5.7 percent to a 1.04 million-unit pace. Permits have been above a 1 million-unit pace since July.U.S. stock index futures extended losses on the data, while prices for U.S. government debt rose. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies.Despite the recent weakness, the outlook for housing remains favorable against the backdrop of a strengthening labor market.While a separate report from the Labor Department showed a surprise rise in the number of people seeking unemployment aid last week, the underlying trend continued to suggest the jobs market was tightening. More long-term unemployed are finding work. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 294,000 for the week ended April 11.But claims tend to be volatile around this time of the year because moving holidays like Easter and the school spring break can throw off the model that the government uses to smooth the data for seasonal fluctuations.The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, ticked up 250 to 282,750 last week. Claims below 300,000 are associated with a strengthening labor market.The number of people still receiving unemployment benefits after an initial week was the lowest since December 2000.With more people receiving a pay check and lending standards eased a bit to attract first-time home buyers, gains in housing are expected this year.Banking giants Bank of America (BAC.N) and JPMorgan (JPM.N) this week reported a surge in mortgage lending in the first quarter.Last month, groundbreaking rebounded sharply in the Northeast and Midwest, which had been affected by snowy and cold weather in February. Starts, however, tumbled 19.3 percent in the West and fell 3.5 percent in the South, where most of the home building takes place.Last month, single-family homes groundbreaking, the largest part of the market, rose 4.4 percent.

It also hired a behavioral analysis firm run by former CIA staff to analyze how Noble's executives talked on a recent earnings call.\nThis type of analysis is the latest unorthodox research method used by short-sellers and independent research firms to boost the impact of reports they issue that challenge companies' accounting methods.QVerity, the company hired by Muddy Waters, says it analyses the way people communicate to assess if they are being deceptive. It looked at how Noble's management responded to questions and interacted with analysts on its conference call.\"The value that clients, particularly investors, are finding is that through behavioral analysis one can identify potential problems that might not be readily identified through other means,\" QVerity's CEO Phil Houston, who had a 25-year stint at the CIA, told Reuters.He says they have many clients in the investment industry ranging from small firms to large financial institutions, but declined to name any.Many are skeptical about the value this kind of analysis brings though, opting instead to stick with traditional research methods.\"Some will think this is interesting, but we are fundamental analysts and have our own methodology and framework for doing company research,\" said Carmen Lee, head of OCBC Investment Research. She added that they have never used behavioral analysis and have no plans to do so.ACCOUNTING SLEUTHSThe past few years have seen a growing number of activist short-sellers, who publish research questioning a company's accounts whilst betting on its share price falling.  They claim they take their research a step further than analysts at banks and brokerages, which enables them to uncover accounting shenanigans. They have often hired private investigators, forensic accountants and visited factories at unscheduled times to probe irregularities at companies they target.Muddy Waters' attack on Noble is the first time any high profile short seller has publicly used behavioral analysis though. Its founder Carson Block said he became interested in it after similar research was done on him and he largely concurred with the assessment, without specifying what the assessment was. \"There might be a reluctance among investors to accept behavioral analysis, similar to the hurdles psychotherapy had to overcome before gaining societal acceptance,\" Block said.Noble hit the spotlight in February when an unknown firm calling itself Iceberg Research published the first of three detailed reports on the company on a blog alleging the commodities trader used aggressive accounting methods.Noble has rejected all of Iceberg's claims and started legal action against a former employee whom it alleged was behind the reports. It is holding its annual shareholders meeting in Singapore on Friday.Muddy Waters said last week that it had a short position on Noble, saying the findings of QVerity - that Noble management showed signs of deceptive behavior in the way they answered analyst questions - supported at least some of Iceberg's allegations.Examples in QVerity's analysis included saying that the way Noble CEO Yusuf Alireza thanked an analyst for his question and referred to him by his first name was a form of \"manipulation behavior\".A spokeswoman for Noble referred Reuters to its recent statement that categorically rejected all of Muddy Waters allegations, including the \"unfounded\" one that it misled investors. Soren Aandahl, head of research at another prominent short-seller Glaucus Research, said he had some qualms about following Muddy Waters in using this type of analysis.\"I'm not sure any conclusions derived from such analysis could be credibly relied upon. I'm also not sure it is necessary,\" he said.Still, he argues that Muddy Waters' tack shows it's short-sellers rather than traditional analysts who come up with the most innovative investment research methods. \"It takes insurgents to push traditional investment paradigms forward,\" he said.

Known as Alexandria, it turned out to be loss-making and triggered a string of judicial investigations in Italy.Monte dei Paschi has been hit by the euro zone debt crisis and a scandal over derivative contracts, including Alexandria. It emerged as the weakest lender in a Europe-wide health check of the sector last year.After a 5 billion euro rights issue last year, the bank is holding a shareholder meeting on Thursday to approve another 3 billion euro cash call to plug the shortfall exposed by European regulators.On Friday, Monte dei Paschi said it was breaching regulatory limits because its 3.4-billion euro exposure to Nomura, linked to the Alexandria trade, accounted for 35 percent of its capital. That is 10 percentage points more than what is allowed.Milan prosecutors have said the bank's former management entered Alexandria and other complex derivative trades to conceal losses after stretching its finances to buy rival Antonveneta in 2007 for 9 billion euros.Monte dei Paschi has already restated its 2012 accounts to reflect losses linked to the derivatives trades. The bank, its former management as well as Nomura are under investigation in Milan over the Alexandria contract, according to prosecutors' documents seen by Reuters. Monte dei Paschi confirmed on Friday it and Nomura were under investigation in the probe.

It has previously denied any wrongdoing and said it always acted correctly.In its letter to the prosecutors Monte dei Paschi said the \"legal proceedings under way would be irreparably weakened\" if the Alexandria trade was closed. The bank noted it would not be able to pursue damages if the trade was closed.Monte dei Paschi is seeking damages for at least 750 million euros from Nomura and former Monte dei Paschi executives in relation to the Alexandria trade.

In aggregate, European Union countries invested $2.02 billion, up 30.5 percent year on year.Exceptionally strong growth in FDI inflows in the first two months of the year, including a nearly 874-percent jump for Saudi Arabia and a 367-percent gain for France, were due to one-off deals, commerce ministry spokesman Shen Danyang said in March.\n        \n        Investment from the U.S. fell 40 percent on the year to $620 million, while ASEAN countries invested $1.35 billion, down 31.2 percent on the year.While the strengthening dollar may have played a role by distorting year-on-year comparisons in dollar terms, the large declines in investment from two of China's major regional trading partners could be seen as a warning sign - particularly in the context of other poor data. Inbound FDI in China rose just 1.7 percent in 2014, the slackest pace since 2012. That weak performance accentuated a cooling economy which is spurring more Chinese firms to plow money into overseas assets - a trend that could soon overtake inbound investment.Last year, China drew a record $119.6 billion of FDI, while outbound investment rose 14.1 percent to a new high of $102.9 billion.The government has been encouraging Chinese firms to invest abroad to make them more competitive internationally, utilize  surplus capacity, and help slow the rapid build-up of foreign exchange reserves.Outbound investment for the first three months of the year combined rose 29.6 percent from the same period in 2014 to $25.79 billion.

Jeremy Stein, a Federal Reserve Board governor for two years, joined hedge fund BlueMountain as a consultant last month.Bernanke told the New York Times that he was sensitive to public anxiety about the \"revolving door\" between Wall Street and Washington.He chose Citadel, in part, because the fund is not regulated by the Federal Reserve and his role would not involve any lobbying. Bernanke told the newspaper that he had declined offers from banks.Chicago-based Citadel, founded in 1990, is a multi-strategy hedge fund and ranks as one of the industry's biggest.

But Yoshikazu Tanaka, chief engineer of Toyota's hydrogen fuel-cell car Mirai, said that would guzzle so much energy at once as to defeat the purpose of the EV as an ecologically sound form of transportation.\"If you were to charge a car in 12 minutes for a range of 500 km (310 miles), for example, you're probably using up electricity required to power 1,000 houses,\" Tanaka told a small group of reporters at the first test-drive event for the production version of the Mirai, the world's only mass-market fuel-cell car. \"That totally goes against the need to stabilize electricity use on the grid.\"Even as rivals such as Nissan and Volkswagen AG promote battery EVs, cars like the Leaf require lengthy charging, reducing their attractiveness for customers planning to drive longer distances frequently. The Leaf requires about eight hours for a full charge using a 200-volt outlet, giving a listed driving range of\u00a0around 84 miles in the United States.\"Toyota isn't denying the benefits of EVs,\" Tanaka said. \"But we think the best way to use them is to charge them at night (to avoid peak power consumption hours), and use them for short distances during the day.\"Instead, Toyota says hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs) offer the most promising zero-emission alternative to conventional cars since they have a similar driving range and refueling time.While FCVs require massive investment and government subsidies for fuelling stations, Tanaka noted that hydrogen - the most abundant element in the universe - could be extracted from many different sources and had the advantage of being portable and more easily stored than electricity.He noted that the southern Japanese city of Fukuoka last month completed a fuelling station that uses hydrogen made from sewage and that could power about 70 Mirai FCVs a day.\"Of course, there are technological hurdles that need to be cleared to make this commercially viable,\" he said.\"But remember 'Back to the Future'?

Last year it was hammered by weakening emerging markets and currency devaluations.\"We are overall starting to see more tailwinds than headwinds,\" Chief Financial Officer Jean Marc Huet said.Foreign exchange rates, for example, are expected to help 2015 sales by about 8 to 9 percent at current rates, he said, after reducing 2014 sales by 4.6 percent. Huet told Reuters that Unilever's full-year sales growth would probably come in at the upper end of its prior stated goal of 2 to 4 percent.In the first quarter, underlying sales rose 2.8 percent, excluding the impact of currency moves, acquisitions and disposals. Analysts on average were expecting a gain of 2.1 percent, according to a company-supplied poll.The company cited a better than expected performance in China, saying that sales were stabilizing, although at \"much lower levels of growth than we've used to\".In the final three months of 2014, Unilever's sales in China fell 20 percent as retailers cut inventories to deal with a slowing economy. Huet said Unilever was now past the worst of the impact from that reduction in stock levels.Unilever gets more than half its sales from emerging markets, and so was particularly hurt by the slowdown last year.In North America, Unilever said more positive consumer sentiment was finally translating into low single-digit market growth helped by price increases. However in Europe, the opposite remained, with volumes growing and deflation seen across the market. Unilever's results contrasted with a weaker performance reported on Thursday by spirits maker Diageo, which still suffered from reduced inventory levels in Southeast Asia .Given the tough backdrop, consumer goods giants Unilever, Nestle and Procter &amp; Gamble have all been selling off underperforming or smaller brands to focus more on their leading products.Huet declined to comment, in an interview, on Unilever's interest in acquiring any brands being sold by Procter &amp; Gamble.

Revenue is expected to slide 10 percent to 200 billion yen, its seventh straight year of decline.It said it was aiming for a return to profit in 2016, helped by a plan to close 131 outlets this year that do not show long-term growth prospects. The company, which has about 3,100 stores currently, will renovate about 2,000 over the next four years.In addition, it aims to shed about 100 headquarter jobs through early retirement and will also seek about 12 billion yen in cost cuts by reducing materials, distribution and overhead costs.McDonald's Japan was hit last year after a major Chinese supplier of chicken was found to have been in breach of food safety standards. It ran into further problems in January when some customers found foreign objects, including a tooth, in their food.Same-store sales slid a record 38.6 percent in January compared with the same month last year, and dropped about 29 percent in February and March.Row Imamura, a company executive, said he expects same store sales to turn positive in the fourth quarter of this year.McDonald's Japan reported its 2014 results in February but did not give its customary earnings guidance at the time.Shares of McDonald's Japan are down about 11 percent from last year's peak set in June.

While relief that a deal with lenders was in its final stages boosted Sharp's shares 4.5 percent to their highest level since December, the plans are likely to viewed as not going far enough by many investors.\"The restructuring is likely to stop the bleeding in terms of losses and cash flow, but it's not going to resolve the basic problems,\" said Yasuo Sakuma, executive officer at Bayview Asset Management.\"It's difficult to assess positively since we're not seeing any strategy toward future growth.\"Sharp spokeswoman Miyuki Nakayama said the company was considering various options but nothing had been decided, adding that more will be revealed in May, when it releases a new business plan.

Smaller planes cost less to fly than the stately, four-engine jumbos, which can carry as many as 525 passengers.The slump in sales of the jets has raised questions over how long manufacturers can sustain production. It has also fueled internal debate in both companies over the future of the planes, sources said.The outcome of those discussions will affect the value of existing fleets and thousands of production jobs at the plane makers and their many parts suppliers.Sales forces at Airbus Group NV (AIR.PA) and Boeing Co (BA.N) are fighting for potential orders plane by plane as they seek to keep production going beyond the end of the decade,  said other aviation market sources. The aircraft makers are offering discounts of at least 50 percent from catalog prices of around $400 million for a jumbo jet, those sources said. Airbus has said it is also considering a revamp to make its 'superjumbo' more attractive to buyers.Boeing in September plans to slow the pace of production of its latest 747-8 model to an average of 1.3 planes a month from 1.5 currently.\u00a0At that rate the orders it already has in hand will only keep the production line going for 2 1/2 years. The crunch, though, will come earlier because it can take up to two years from ordering the first part to finishing a jet, and no one wants to start the process if it is unclear whether the plane will be completed and delivered to a customer.\"I can see demand for the 747-8 in small numbers, but you have got to ask if they can keep the production line open if they don't get some new orders,\" said Tony Whitty, chief executive of UK-based aircraft re-marketing firm Cabot Aviation, which trades, manages and leases jets. \"You also wonder at what price they are selling.\" LONG DESCENTUse of the 747 has dropped steadily over the last two decades, reflecting the rise of two-engine jets that have come close to matching its range.\u00a0Over the same period production of large twin-engined jets like the Boeing 777 has risen seven-fold. Last year, Boeing booked 283 new orders for the 777 and now has a backlog of 547 orders.Airbus is more upbeat than Boeing about the prospects for jumbo jets but both now agree it has become a niche category. Airlines still need jumbo jets but only for certain polar flights - where a two-engine jet may be less safe than a four-engine jumbo because of the lack of places for an emergency landing - and busy routes where landing slots are scarce.The risk is most visible for Boeing, where investors could face a $1 billion accounting charge if 747 production is shut down, according to company disclosures. Boeing recently received a high-profile boost with a provisional order for two new jets to serve as Air Force One for the U.S. President but the 747's future depends a lot more on sales of the much-less glamorous windowless freight\u00a0model. That  has a unique hinged nose and can carry very large equipment, such as oil drilling rigs.So far this year, Boeing has sold three. Atlas Air Worldwide (AAWW.O) recently said it plans to order more for its cargo fleet, but wouldn't say when or how many. The world's biggest 747 freight customer, Cargolux [CLUX.UL], also says it likes the plane, but has a pending order for only three.A sustained upturn in air freight traffic could secure the 747 a longer future. International freight traffic rose 4.8 percent last year, but volume has only just recovered from a collapse in 2009 during the financial crisis.CARGO HAULERBoeing reckons some 143 older freighters will need to be replaced, stretching demand for the 747 through the 2020s, the program vice president, Bruce Dickinson, said in an interview.\"We know there is a long-term market for this airplane and some of the unique things it can do,\" Dickinson said from his office overlooking the 747 production line at the giant Everett plant near Seattle.But Boeing\u2019s effort to sell new 747s is overshadowed by the many older 747s available for lease, which have suddenly been made more attractive because of a big slide in fuel prices since the middle of last year. Leasing companies say there is scant interest in new 747-8s when 82 freighters are baking in desert parking lots. The older planes can be leased for as little as $400,000 a month, compared with up to $1.4 million in monthly lease payments for a new 747-8 freighter, experts say.\"That's a pretty big difference,\" said Gueric Dechavanne, vice president at Collateral Verifications, a Connecticut-based aircraft appraisal firm. Some companies have extended 747 leases for three to four years, said Aengus Kelly, chief executive of leasing company AerCap (AER.N).\"It's a challenge to lease a freighter,\" Kelly told Reuters. \"It's definitely a challenge to sell them.\" Airbus\u2019s A380 is a newer plane \u2013 its first flight was almost exactly 10 years ago - and has become a mainstay of Middle East carriers that offer opulent suites to first class passengers. But the drop in demand is prompting Airbus to weigh whether to revamp the plane with new engines, or carry on with the existing model.\u00a0 Airbus has 161 orders for the planes in hand, or more than five years of production. But it acknowledges that not all of those jets will be delivered, leaving it with barely three years of guaranteed output. Given the long lead times,\u00a0Airbus must bring in more orders soon to avoid having to taper production.\u201cWe are always looking at product improvements, but there is so much untapped potential in the existing aircraft,\u201d said Airbus marketing\u00a0head Chris Emerson. Airbus could announce an A380 revamp as early as the Dubai Airshow in November, but must first find a way to assure investors it can recover several billion dollars of development costs, sources said. Analysts say on option could be to apply for more European government loans, though that risks exacerbating trade tensions with the United States. Top customer Emirates is offering to double its planned purchase of 140 A380s if Airbus carries out the improvements, which the Dubai carrier\u2019s Chief Executive Tim Clark tells Reuters will be \"extremely good for the (airline\u2019s) bottom line.\" But Airbus\u2019s board is unlikely to back a new A380 model for just one customer.

Morris and the followers of the Arts and Crafts movement, which spanned Britain, the United States and Japan in the late 19th century, argued that mass manufactured products devalued labour and led to cheap and ugly surroundings.It's not too big a stretch to argue that the 21st century version of that argument is \"buy good things from real people\" - the motto of online crafts marketplace Etsy.Founded a decade ago in Brooklyn, New York - the epicentre of the do-it-yourself (DIY) movement - Etsy is billed as the \"artisanal\" eBay, a place where crafters can sell their wares to like-minded buyers.The site has capitalised on a generational shift, where younger consumers value knowing where and how their purchases are made - and are willing to spend more for that knowledge.

That is a private label granted to firms that audit their business, grading their efforts on such criteria as workplace diversity to sustainability.\"We believe that business has a higher social purpose beyond simply profit,\" he wrote. \n                        Etsy is based in the Dumbo neighbourhood of Brooklyn\n                    \n                While the certification was lauded at the time by Etsy's sellers and buyers, the company's commitment to putting ethics about profit is now about to be tested in the marketplace.News of the company's decision to list on the Nasdaq met with a mixed reaction from Etsy sellers, who posted hundreds of notes in forums on the site.\"[I] went thru this with eBay. It will now be all about the shareholders and how much money they can make for them and no one else,\" wrote one seller of vintage jewellery.Many users said they viewed the decision to go public as part of a larger trend away from the company's small DIY ethos - particularly after Etsy decided to amend its rules to allow sellers to let outside manufacturers make their goods.But Lisa Yen, who runs the Etsy shop Moss+Twig from her one-bedroom apartment in Flatbush, Brooklyn, where she makes terrariums filled with moss and whimsical accoutrements such as coral and figurines that cost between $26 and $75, says she is optimistic.\n                        Lisa Yen started her Etsy, Moss &amp; Twig, store nearly two years ago\n                    \n                \"I think actually once they start offering shares the company will start growing [and] it will just expand the programmes they can offer their sellers,\" says Ms Yen, who has benefitted from Etsy programmes that link sellers with large retailers such as Nordstrom.\"There's still a lot of people who don't know what Etsy is, so it's going to get a lot of traction and I can only see good coming out of this.\"\n                        Ms Yen makes moss terariums, which she sells for between $26 and $75 a piece\n                    \n                \n                        Ms Yen says she sells about $1,000 worth of goods a month on Etsy\n                    \n                Don't forgetWhile there is nothing illegal in prioritising social good over profits, according to Brooklyn Law School professor Dana Brakman Reiser, the problem for Etsy is that there are very few other firms who have signed on to the B corporation platform that have also attempted to appeal to outside investors.\"Etsy is going to have to be persuasive to a much larger and more diverse group of shareholders now,\" says Prof Brakman Reiser.\"Many people think is going to scare investors off, who think 'why would I invest in a company that's going to trade my profits for social good? I'll just get the profits and buy my own social good by making a donation?'.\"The challenge for Etsy will be to maintain a high enough share price and a sufficiently diverse investor base who will see value in the company's more expensive decisions. If it fails to do so, the company could become a target for a takeover by a larger rival such as eBay.What is a B Corp?Created in 2006 by the non-profit B Labs, a B Corporation (or B Corp) is one that has audited itself to evaluate its performance on a series of metrics including the company's commitment to sustainability and diversity. If the firm gets a score above 80 (out of a possible 200) it can call itself a B Corp and advertise its commitment to social good. The label is like those given to organic or Fairtrade food - a private certification \"intended to demonstrate that this is a company that is using its business to also achieve some kind of social good\", according to Prof Brakman Reiser.B Corps are different, although related, to Benefit Corporations, which are legal entities. Some, but not all, US states allow companies to register as Benefit Corporations, which is a legal category different than that of a Limited Liability Corporation (LLC), for instance.Etsy, which is registered in the US state of Delaware, is technically supposed to register as a Benefit Corporation as part of its adherence to the B Corp programme, which it has not yet done. DIY IPOThat is why Prof Brakman Reiser and others have said that Etsy is making a canny move in prioritising its sellers - and other smaller investors - in its public share sale.Unlike the public stock offerings of other technology companies such as Facebook or Twitter, in which smaller investors were largely excluded from buying shares ahead of the listing, Etsy has specifically advertised its offering to the sellers on its site.The company has set aside 5% of its shares to allow smaller investors to purchase between $100 and $2,500 worth of Etsy stock. Kenneth Manger, who runs a new Etsy store, printswonderful, is one of the hopeful buyers.\"I was surprised when I clicked on the little IPO thing that they had on the website that they actually would make shares available to small investors,\" he says.\n                        Kenneth Manger runs an Etsy store called printswonderful\n                    \n                He says that while he cannot claim to be an Etsy expert, he appreciates the company's commitment to creativity. That is why he is willing to take a risk investing in a company that is yet to turn a profit.If Etsy is successful - and success, in this instance, will be more than just whether shares in the firm \"pop\", or rise significantly in their first day of trading, which is expected to be Thursday - it could serve as a model for other like-minded firms.\"If Etsy demonstrates continued growth stable or rising share price and a lot of liquidity for investors, that's proof of concept that this kind of company can get funding on the public markets,\" says Prof Brakman Reiser.\n    ", "newspaper": "BBC", "id": 279, "pubdate": "Thu, 16 Apr 2015 14:48:38 +0530", "title": "Can craft and capitalism coexist?"}, {"content": "MUMBAI: Public sector lender  IDBI Bank today said it is awaiting correct valuation before coming out with a follow-on public offer, which will help it shore up its capital base.

Buying  gold on the occasion is considered a must, as it is believed to bode prosperity, luck, and well-being.So, should one invest in gold at current levels?Gold has always been an attractive asset class, due to its distinctive investment feature like providing hedge against inflation. Besides, in life crises, people have turned to digging their family gold to survive.However, experts advise caution and favour only token purchases of the precious metal on Akshaya Tritiya. They, however, go on to suggest that accumulating gold at lower levels in a staggered manner would be a good idea.After having given significant returns over the past decade, gold prices have lost some sheen over the last two years, amid termination of the US bond buying programme and persistent talks of a interest rate hike by the  US Federal Reserve for the first time since 2006. This has dampened gold prices.  The outlook for gold is not very optimistic, and there could be more pain in store. The key factor working against gold right now is the imminent rate hike by the US Federal Reserve, along with the  Greece debt crisis. The US Fed has dropped enough hints that interest rates may be hiked this year.\"Uncertainty regarding timing of hike in interest rates by US Federal Reserve and rupee-dollar movement may give further direction to the prices,\"  SMC Capital said in a note.

Greece has another 768 million falling due in May.However, there is likelihood that the worst in gold prices has already been discounted by the market, and when the interest rate hike actually comes into effect, probably later during the year, there should only be a marginal negative impact, said a Religare report.Indian festive-buying, which begins today on Akshaya Tritiya, may give further support to the prices. Some correction in dollar index will stimulate further buying in gold.\"Soft domestic prices and the wedding season which is set to begin on this day and continue till June, are likely to perk up the demand for gold and lead to higher jewellery sales, up by around 25-30% this Akshaya Tritiya,\" says Jayant Manglik, President, Retail Distribution, Religare Securities.Globally, central banks from Europe, China, and Japan are taking steps to ward off fears of deflation and spur growth, by introducing stimulus measures that may support gold prices.How much should you buy?Gold has always been a popular financial asset for all investors due to its safe-haven appeal. It generally performs well in times of economic crises, such as currency failure, high  inflation and stock market crash. Not individuals, but central banks also try and hoard gold to deal with crises.\"While it is possible to ignore gold from a returns perspective, its risk mitigation characteristics make it a compelling inclusion in any investment portfolio,\" says  Rajiv Shastri, MD &amp; CEO, Peerless Fund Management Co. Ltd.\"A hybrid strategy, which incorporates Gold in the portfolio from a risk mitigation perspective, has the potential to enhance returns without a proportionate increase in risk,\" he adds.\"Our statistical analysis shows that in a portfolio with a right mix of equity, bonds and gold, minimum returns generated over 3 and 5 year periods are higher than the median returns generated by bond funds,\" added Shastri.Experts suggest that you should have at least 5% and not more than 15% of your portfolio in gold. The best way to buy the metal is by adding small quantities when prices are down.Unfortunately, this approach is easy in case of gold ETFs and  bullion but can be challenging when it comes to jewellery.\"Last year, Indian investors purchased gold ETFs worth Rs 71.27 crore on this festive day (Akshaya Tritiya) and this year, we expect demand to surge by 30%-35%, as the current scenario is painting a rosy picture, with price trading at a discount from the high of around Rs 35000/10 gms in the year 2013, which is a strong positive for  retail investors in the country,\" says Manglik.Landed cost of gold in India is what that matters for Indian investors. And with  rupee on track towards losing value against the dollar, gold is likely to benefit in the near term.Manglik advocates accumulation gold at lower levels of around Rs 25,500-26,000/10gm for targets of Rs 30,700-31,200 from a medium-term perspective.(With inputs from ET Bureau)", "newspaper": "Economic Times", "id": 283, "pubdate": "Tue, 21 Apr 2015 15:11:55 +0530", "title": "Gold rush on Akshaya Tritiya - make haste, slowly"}, {"content": "MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India's intervention to temper the rupee's rise is inflating  foreign exchange hedging costs, impeding its own efforts to bolster Corporate India's defenses against potential currency turbulence. For long, one of the biggest concerns for the RBI has been the risk of a destabilising outflow of funds as the U.S. Federal Reserve edges closer towards raising interest rates from historic lows. However, it is the rush of foreign money coming into Asia's third-biggest economy - about $14.3 billion has flowed into debt and equity markets this year - that is putting the central bank in a tight spot, forcing it to buy dollars in the spot market and sell them in the forward market. The effect of removing excess rupees from the system as the RBI sterilises the inflationary effect of money supply has further driven up rupee interest rates above dollar rates. This means banks and companies have to pay more rupees to hedge their dollar liabilities in the futures markets. Ashish Vaidya, head of trading, asset liability management at DBS in Mumbai, said the RBI has to walk a fine line as it looks to ensure price stability while taking the upward pressure off the rupee from capital inflows. \"The RBI is buying dollars in the spot market and then paying forward to remove the surge of rupee liquidity, as it has to maintain price stability,\" he said. Corporates must now pay upwards of 7.6 percent to buy dollars and sell rupees to meet future obligations. The 6-month forward premium on the dollar versus the rupee has risen by around 35 basis points so far in 2015. \"The implication of higher forward dollar/rupee premium is importers are hedging less than they should, which is a risk to the banking system,\" said  Anindya Das Gupta, managing director, head of trading at  Barclays in India - precisely the kind of risk the RBI wants to minimise. Underscoring the perils of inadequate hedging, the rupee fell 0.9 percent intraday on Monday - its steepest slide since Dec 16. Last October, RBI Deputy Governor  H.R. Khan warned the hedge ratio for overseas loans and foreign convertible debt had halved to around 15 percent in July-August from the previous fiscal year. CAPITAL FLOWS The rupee was the third best performing currency in Asia in the March quarter, rising 0.85 percent - backed by rising inflows on optimism over economic growth, stable  inflation and structural reforms. It has retreated since then and is up around 0.2 percent so far in 2015. The robust capital inflows have boosted importers' confidence that any rupee depreciation will be less costly than a hedge, while most exporters have also been lax about hedging on  the view the currency will move in a tight band. \"If we hedge, we will lose a lot of money,\" a  senior official at a state-run oil company said, noting the short import payments period. The stubbornly strong rupee has ramped up RBI's operations in the spot  forex market - it bought a net $20 billion in January and February. The central bank has also been swapping rupees for dollars in the forward market, adding $260 million in up to one-year dollar contracts in February. In contrast, the RBI's net dollar holdings in tenors up to one-year fell sharply by $6.49 billion in December. \"We are not going to maintain any particular level for the rupee and so they (firms) have to recognize that they are taking on a big risk,\" Governor Raghuram Rajan said earlier this month, sounding a warning to firms that aren't hedging their currency exposure.

Insurers and mutual funds have also raised their ownership of government papers, given such high yields may not return for many years. The share of commercial banks in government bonds has dipped to 42.77 per cent in December 2014 from 44.73 per cent a year earlier, according to the latest data from the  Reserve bank of India. The RBI has gradually lowered the level of deposits that a commercial bank must park in government papers. In the last seven years, the statutory liquidity ratio, or SLR, has been brought to 21.5 per cent, down from 25 per cent in November 2009. Historically, it has been observed that banks tend to park more funds in G-secs during the period of low credit offtake while they sell their bond portfolio when credit demand picks up. With loan demand expected to pick up from the second and third quarter of FY16 \u2014 after loan growth touched an 18-year low of 12.67 per cent in FY15 \u2014 commercial banks' share in government bonds could slip further. \"Banks may not rush to buy government bonds as their SLR requirement is coming down... and the system is holding surplus SLR to the extent of about 6 per cent,\" said Harihar Krishnamoorthy, head treasurer at  FirstRand Bank. \"Also, yields are coming off and below marginal term deposit rates. Moreover, loan growth and deposit growth were almost similar in FY15, leaving little residual surplus liquidity, unlike in the past when deposit growth rate outstripped advances growth by a large margin, leaving surplus liquidity for investments in bonds,\" he said. With the investment corpus of  insurance companies and mutual funds going up on account of higher penetration and growing number of players in the market, their share in the government bonds market has also gradually gone up. Moreover, the RBI has also allowed foreign portfolio investors to invest an aggregate of $30 billion a year in governments bonds. \"Markets are yield-hungry as global liquidity is very high and India stands out among its peers in emerging markets,\" said Ajay Mahajan, head, financial markets group at IDFC. \"Foreign currency funding costs are at all-time lows while India's relative attractiveness compared to other countries in EM would be at an all-time high. This has drawn many FPIs to India,\" he said. Insurance companies already account for 21.02 per cent per cent of market share in government bonds and experts expect their share to increase. \"Going forward, insurance companies would be big buyers of government bonds as the sector is still a sunrise sector,\" said Krishnamurthy.

In particular, Alwaleed points to what he says is James' ability to grasp the digital world and understand how it is transforming the media landscape, adding: \"I really love him!\" The billionaire prince's seal of approval - and increasing acceptance of James by other shareholders - may be laying the ground for Fox to give the 42-year-old day-to-day control of the company sooner rather than later. One person familiar with the family's thinking said James, who is currently co-chief operating officer with Chase Carey, could take over fully from Carey - who also holds the title of president - as early as the end of this year.The source cautioned that the change hasn't been formalized and could be subject to delay. It is also unclear what title James would take or whether there is any possibility that Rupert Murdoch, 84, would relinquish the Fox CEO position to him anytime soon.Carey's contract is set to expire on June 30, 2016, but he can leave the company as early as the end of this year with six months notice. Fox declined to comment. James Murdoch declined to be interviewed for this article.What is clear is that some key investors seem to be warming to the idea that James has the chops to run Fox. That was not always the case. In interviews, some top investors who know James, and other people familiar with the company, describe him as curious and a risk taker like his father. But they also cite two big differences that they like: James is less sentimental about certain assets than his dad and he is more enthusiastic about courting shareholders.In 2013, James and his older brother Lachlan, 43, were elected as directors of Fox \u2013 but only on the strength of votes\u00a0 cast by the family.\u00a0Assuming the Murdoch family and Alwaleed voted for the two sons (the prince has previously said he tends to vote with the Murdochs), it means that 71 percent of the rest of the shareholders voting opposed James \u2013 and 90 percent cast their votes against Lachlan.In contrast, after James was made co-COO and Lachlan co-chairman of Fox last year, only 24 percent of the independent stakeholders voting opposed both their board nominations if the same voting assumptions for the family and Alwaleed are correct.\u00a0 Fox declined to comment on those assumptions.James \"really works hard just like his father,\" said Saad Mohseni, chairman and CEO of the Afghan media company Moby Group, in which Fox holds a stake. \"He doesn't get the benefit of the doubt. For him, every step of the way he has to prove himself.\"If James gets Carey's role he will be running the day-to-day operations of a sprawling media behemoth with a market value of close to $73 billion. It owns cable assets, broadcast networks and movie studios, including Twentieth Century Fox movie studio, Fox News and Star India.The Murdochs own 39 percent of voting shares in Fox and News Corp, the company that operates newspapers like The Wall Street Journal and book publisher HarperCollins, through a family trust. Fox split from News Corp in 2013.The prospect of a Fox completely run by the Murdochs does still concern some investors.Many shareholders say they have great respect for Carey, 61, a long-time Murdoch lieutenant who has worked in the role since 2009. The thinking: Carey is not only a good operator but he also keeps the family in check\u00a0 - especially when acquisitions are concerned.\"We are very happy with how things are now,\" said one top Fox shareholder, adding that having the Murdochs running the show in the top three positions without having anyone to provide an alternative voice wasn't a comfortable prospect.PHONE HACKING SCANDALA Harvard drop out, James spent his early career as a cartoonist and co-founder of hip hop label Rawkus Records, which was bought by News Corp.He joined News Corp in 1996, at the age of 23 and was soon installed as head of the company's Asian assets, including Star India. Four years later, he was named CEO of BSkyB, now known as Sky, that is 39 percent owned by Fox.People close to James said one of his weaknesses was that he wasn't humble about getting big roles at the company from such an early age. He never quite accepted that he only got those jobs because he was Rupert's son, said one of these people. Still, they said James has now matured and that while he may have been brash at times when he was younger he was successful in improving the group\u2019s businesses in Asia and Europe. By far the biggest setback James faced was when he was in charge of News Corp's British newspapers and he had to deal with the phone hacking scandal at its UK tabloid newspaper The News of the World, which was closed as a result. Some of the paper's journalists were alleged to have illegally tapped phones and bribed officials in pursuit of stories. While the alleged hacking occurred before James took charge, his critics said he failed to recognize the significance of the problem and didn't conduct as thorough an internal investigation as necessary. In one oversight, he admitted he didn't fully read an email sent to him in 2008 detailing allegations against the paper that were made by the English soccer players union.However, a British parliamentary committee cleared James of any wrongdoing and the U.S. Department of Justice declined to prosecute News Corp and Fox after an investigation. James left London for New York in 2012. FACEBOOK NO MORE?For the past three years, James has worked with Carey and other Fox executives to learn about the U.S. media market and repair the damage to his reputation. He has started to emerge at industry functions like the annual media mogul confab in Sun Valley and as a keynote speaker at industry conferences. One person who knows the family said that Rupert has been indifferent to investors his entire career. \"James is more sensitive,\" this person said. Rupert Murdoch has often been perceived to do what he likes, especially as it concerns acquisitions, several investors said. One example that is often raised is News Corp\u2019s $5.6 billion purchase in 2007 of Dow Jones, the publisher of the Wall Street Journal, an investment that was later written down by half. Several sources say James played a key role in the decision not to make a hostile bid for Time Warner last year.\u00a0He assured investors that Fox was going to be cautious on how fast and how aggressive it would be in its pursuit of Time Warner, fearing that it could overpay. He was instrumental in last year's consolidation of its European pay-TV assets that led to BSkyB buying Fox\u2019s stakes in Sky Deutschland and Sky Italia, resulting in a new pan-European pay TV company Sky according to people familiar with the matter. Along with those big investments he was also involved in some of Fox's digital investments in the next generation of advertising and TV viewing, including the purchase of a 5 percent stake in Vice, the acquisition of True [X], which helps broadcasters sell digital advertising, and an investment in Roku, the streaming video player, sources said.\"Every time I look behind me or I look ahead of me, I see James,\" said David Zaslav, CEO of Discovery Communications.Prince Alwaleed even says if James had been at the helm he could have prevented one of the Murdoch empire's most embarrassing stumbles - News Corp's failure to develop MySpace after buying the social media site in 2005.\u00a0 \"MySpace would now be flying,\" Alwaleed said, \"and there would be no Facebook today.\"  (Additional reporting by Nadia Damouni; Editing by Hank Gilman and Martin Howell)", "newspaper": "Reuters", "id": 293, "pubdate": "Tue, 21 Apr 2015 11:45:45 +0530", "title": "With a prince's backing, James Murdoch may soon ascend at Fox"}, {"content": "\n\n(Reuters) - Hints that U.S. regulators could veto Comcast Corp's proposed $45 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable Inc have investment bankers worried about whether they will get paid, with smaller advisory firms particularly on edge.\nBoutique investment banks such as Allen &amp; Company, Centerview Partners and Paul Taubman's PJT Partners have limited resources compared to their larger brethren, and they use them to win mandates on a few big deals. Yet it is megadeals such as the Comcast-Time Warner Cable buyout, that carry the most regulatory risk.\"Big banks have many deals going on, and they can afford to lose one more, even though it is painful. Smaller firms are less diversified, so for them it\u2019s much more painful,\" said Campbell Harvey, a professor of international business at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business.At least $140 million in investment banking advisory fees are at risk if the Department of Justice ends up blocking the deal. Bloomberg News reported on Friday that staff attorneys at the department's antitrust division were nearing a recommendation to veto the takeover because of concern about its impact on consumers. As much as $170 million in fees on two smaller transactions tied to the Time Warner buyout involving Comcast rival Charter Communications Inc may be in peril too, according to estimates by consulting firm Freeman &amp; Co LLC.To be sure, bankers often negotiate a provision that allows them to be paid a fraction of the agreed fee if the deal falls through. These agreements are not public, but Freeman &amp; Co estimates they amount to just 10 to 15 percent of the fee with a consummated transaction.JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, former top Morgan Stanley banker Taubman and Barclays, which jointly advised Comcast, would split an estimated $51 million to $68 million in advisory fees if the proposed takeover goes through, according to Freeman.Financial advisers to Time Warner Cable - Morgan Stanley, Allen &amp; Company, Citigroup Inc and Centerview Partners - are set to share $57 million to $75 million in fees, the estimates show.Taubman finished 2014 ranked 23rd in the worldwide mergers &amp; acquisitions league tables based on four deals, according to Thomson Reuters data. However, without Comcast, his ranking would fall out of the top 100. Centerview, which worked on 45 announced deals and was ranked 12th last year, would fall to 15th without the cable deal.CHAIN REACTIONIf the Comcast-Time Warner Cable takeover were to be scuttled, Charter and Comcast's three-part transaction that swaps subscribers, divests some Time Warner Cable subscribers to Charter and creates a spinoff company called GreatLand Communications, would also be scrapped. That deal would generate up to $87 million for the advisers, according to Freeman.Charter's $10.4 billion acquisition of closely held cable provider Bright House Networks, which Freeman said could generate up to $83 million in banker fees, can also be called off if Comcast-Time Warner Cable is not approved. Time Warner Cable has a right of first offer on Bright House, and could exercise it if Comcast walked away, analysts said.Liontree and Goldman Sachs, Charter's advisers on the Time Warner Cable asset swap and the Bright House acquisition, would see a short-term loss in fees if Comcast's takeover of Time Warner Cable fell apart. In the long run, though, they could come out on top. Charter has been vocal about its plans to go after Time Warner Cable should it become available again - a deal that could raise fewer antitrust red flags because it would involve less market concentration than the Comcast takeover. Charter could then use the same set of advisers.Backing the right horse can be a difficult calculation. Barclays had originally been working for Charter on the financing side when it was first planning to buy Time Warner Cable, but then switched sides to work with Comcast last year, sources familiar with the matter said at the time.

After Chevron successfully argued the case should be heard in Ecuador, the villagers filed a new lawsuit there.The case led to a $19 billion judgment against Chevron, which Ecuador's highest court in 2013 slashed to $9.5 billion.Chevron, meanwhile, sued Donziger and others in federal court in Manhattan, claiming the judgment was the product of fraud.In 2014, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan concluded that Donziger's team used bribery, fraud and extortion to secure the judgment. He barred Donziger from profiting from it and banned its enforcement in the United States.Chevron no longer has operations in Ecuador. But the plaintiffs have gone after its assets in Canada, Brazil and Argentina, and Kaplan's ruling provided ammunition against those efforts.On Monday, Circuit Judge Richard Wesley called the case \"unmanageable.\"He said Kaplan's findings, for example, could soon be contradicted by an arbitration panel set to hear Chevron's claims against Ecuador that it was wrongly denied the right to a fair hearing.Wesley asked if a solution might be to rewind the clock to have the case tried in New York as the Ecuadorians originally wanted.\"Why not order a retrial?\" he asked. \"Why not cleanse the question of fraud?\"The oral arguments on Monday lasted for more than an hour.

In fact, it is part of a global trend which is now showing up in India too, according to experts, with evidence of this being seen by practitioners including Kroll Advisory, KPMG, EY and PWC.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tAt the root of such decisions is the fact that many offers are underwritten, which means that the banker offers to pick up the securities in an offer if they remain unsold. This can creates a large financial liability for the banker if the issue goes awry.\u201cInvestment bankers are using various means to get comfortable on capital raises etc\u2026I am seeing the first signs of some specific procedures that are in the nature of forensic checks being requested for being incorporated as part of the diligence process,\u201d said Sandeep Dhupia - Head, Forensic Services at KPMG in India.&#13;\n&#13;\n\t\u201cIt has picked up over the last 12 months as the economy has begun to look better.

The latter may want to find out if their money has been siphoned off by the promoters.&#13;\n&#13;\n\t&#13;\n\tThe former want to make sure that their investment will be in safe hands. Investment bankers too face similar risk exposure and wish to run qualitative and quantitative checks on the person or company with whom business is being done.&#13;\n&#13;\n\t\"Sometimes, in IPO situations, the underwriter who takes the exposure may appoint a firm to conduct a reputational due diligence. This includes background checks covering the company, it\u2019s Directors and key management personnel. Such due diligence can also include searching for unknown related parties, looking into significant transactions with such related parties, whether a key related party is in financial distress or has large loans backed by corporate guarantees and if there have been regulatory issues associated with the parties involved,\u201d said Dhruv Phophalia, Managing Director with Alvarez &amp; Marsal, leading the firm\u2019s Global Forensic and Dispute Services practice in India.&#13;\n&#13;\n\t\u201cIndia\u2019s positive business environment has drawn the interest of global investment banks, however they are increasingly aware of the risks prevalent...background checks involve understanding the integrity and credibility of the individual to identify any red flags or dubious connections.

Given the fixed costs, the move, which may result in subscribers opting for the service only for a part of the month, will impact Dish TV's leverage and margins.Given the offer seems to be targeted at the semi urban and rural markets, this could impact Dish TV as it has large subscriber base in these markets. Phase III and Phase IV compulsory digitisation is in the semi urban markets and are scheduled to be implemented by December 2015 and December 2016.Dish TV management has, however, said the move by its rival will not affect it. R C Venkateish, Chief Executive Officer, says that from a new customer acquisition perspective, there is zero impact as a customer who will pay Rs 8 once in a while is not going to pay Rs 2,000 upfront. \u201cAs far as new customers are concerned those on Dish platform won\u2019t be impacted. Tata Sky is downgrading its own customers, which is why this is a self goal.\u201dTata Sky is looking at tapping the rural base further with this low denomination recharge which will enable the DTH subscriber the flexibility to pay for days of use rather than a monthly subscription where the service may not be availed on a daily basis.Dish TV, on the other hand, has been customising its content for regional audiences with its brand Zing. The Tata Sky move, according to analysts, could also be a move to counter the success of Zing.

The poor quality of wheat might also discourage private players, increasing the burden on Food Corporation of India (FCI) and state agencies.The highest shortfall in procurement has been in Punjab, where wheat purchase by state agencies and FCI has been eight per cent less than last year\u2019s.The unseasonal rain and hail, which started from late February and continued into April, has damaged standing wheat in 3.86 million hectares of the total crop sown in 30 million hectares, according to estimates as on April 7.According to agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh, the overall production of wheat \u2014 the biggest foodgrain grown during the rabi season \u2014 might fall four to five per cent against the earlier estimates of 96 mt.&#13;\n\u201cWe feel the overall wheat procurement might have to be lowered by at least two million tonnes as output might get impacted in crucial producing states,\u201d said a senior food ministry official.According to the official, purchases are unlikely to be significantly less than last year\u2019s as the Centre has relaxed the quality parameters to enable more farmers to sell wheat to the government.\u201cThat apart, the private traders who had been big buyers for the past few years might not be very enthusiastic this year to purchase from farmers because of poor quality, leaving FCI and state agencies being the only big buyers in the market,\u201d said the official.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tAlready, private traders have placed export order for import of 70,000-80,000 tonnes of wheat over fears of poor quality in the domestic crop. The imports are the highest since 2010. The imports are for April and May, the two months when domestic procurement is the highest.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tThe Centre on its part has relaxed the quality norms for procurement of wheat, but has done them with a reduction in their value.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tThe Centre had on April 8 relaxed the procurement norms for the 2015-16 marketing season in Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Haryana and expressed its willingness to do the same in other states as well.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tAccording to the new norms, the FCI would henceforth procure wheat having \"lustre lost grains\" up to 25 per cent in Gujarat, 40 per cent in Madhya Pradesh and 50 per cent in Rajasthan. The current norms prohibit procurement of a single wheat grain, which has lost lustre.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tSimilarly, it will purchase any amount of broken rice in Gujarat, but will do so if these are 10 per cent in Madhya Pradesh and nine per cent in Rajasthan, against the current practice of buying these even if broken rice is six per cent.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tHowever, farmers whose below-par wheat is purchased for the Central pool will face a cut of Rs 14.5 a quintal in the minimum support price (MSP) for their produce.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tThe MSP is fixed for the fair average quality of grain that is purchased by the FCI and its agencies.

We expect Google to make most dents in the Indian market through its Android One program.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tFacebook (Buy; Target price: US$92): Facebook is the second-most visited website in India. We believe Facebook can play an active role in eCommerce space with emergence of e-shops and through the sale of ad space. We expect retailers to increasingly invest in Facebook advertising to drive traffic to their own sites, particularly as more sophisticated advertising tools are adopted.&#13;\n&#13;\n\teBay (Buy; Target price: US$62): eBay management has been clear about its intentions for growth in BRIC and EM in general and plans to increase sales in these geographies by 4x. In our view, eBay is capable of making significant investments to achieve these BRIC market goals, both organically and inorganically. eBay also has exposure to the Indian eCommerce market through its investment in Snapdeal, which provides eBay with access to SnapDeal's active user base and technology (software, distribution capabilities).&#13;\n&#13;\n\tTwitter (Buy, Target price: $58): Twitter's acquisition of Zipdial (mobile marketing firm unique to emerging markets) to make Twitter content more accessible in markets such as India and over time, increase the number of marketing opportunities for Twitter?s advertising customers. We expect it to gain with the emergence of target advertising.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tAmazon (Neutral, Target price: $355): Amazon is one of the significant etailers in India and operates through market-place model.While India's current contribution to Amazon's total revenue is low, we expect substantial gains from Indian eCommerce and expect the company to remain a top two or three player in future. Amazon is the largest foreign and listed company in Indian etail and has an added advantage of its multiple geographical experience, global best practice and technology accessibility.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tNasper (Buy, Target price: South African Rand 2,130): Nasper has investments in Flipkart (general retail), Ibibo (online travel), OLX (classifieds), PayU (payments) and Redbus (online bus booking). Most of the companies it has invested in are leaders in their respective verticals, and as such we think Naspers is well-placed to benefit from the growth in Indian eCommerce.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tRocket Internet (Neutral, Target price: euro51): Rocket Internet has a portfolio of investments in the Indian eCommerce space with a primary focus on internet retailing through Jabong (Fashion), Fab Furnish (Furniture), Food Panda (food delivery), Coupon Nation (group buying/deals), Print Avenue (order printing) and Office Yes (stationary).

Investments through P-notes stood at Rs 3.23 lakh crore in February 2008.\u201cTaxation on the MAT front has been one of the key reasons for investors choosing to invest through P-notes in the past year. But going forward, since it is not going to be levied, there would be no specific reason for investors to choose this particular route,\u201d said Avinash Gupta, managing director, Alpen Capital.P-notes or offshore derivative instruments can be used by foreign investors who have not registered with Sebi to invest in India. These are used primarily by high net worth individuals (HNIs), hedge funds and other foreign financial institutions, invest through registered foreign portfolio investors (FPIs).FPIs incorporated as companies are liable to pay MAT. However, this is not applicable to investors coming through the P-notes. Just as other investors in India, FPIs pay no tax on long-term capital gains. Imposition of MAT will change this to a minimum tax of 18.5 per cent, which along with the surcharge would make the effective tax rate 20.01 per cent.&#13;\n\t&#13;\n\u201cIf the investors come through the regular, direct route and agree to pay tax in India, then the effective tax rate for those entities will be 20 per cent. But if the investor comes through the P-note route, then he does not have to pay tax if the issuer can make sure the investors are entitled to the tax-treaties,\u201d said Suresh Swamy, partner (financial services), PwC Tax and Regulatory Services.Finance minister Arun Jaitley, in his Budget presentation in February, had said MAT would not be levied for investments from April. But reports suggest the government is looking at impose the tax retrospectively, and has already sent out notices to FPIs defaulting on such payment. This is expected to add Rs 40,000 crore to the government\u2019s kitty.Experts believe the fear and uncertainty surrounding the levying of MAT could have a negative impact on the investment sentiment on India. While India continues to remain an attractive destination for investment, such tax uncertainties could render the direct route of investments unpopular.Sector analysts said the popularity of P-notes could go up further. \u201cFrom a tax standpoint, investors will not have the comfort of coming through the direct route and would prefer to come in through P-notes,\u201d said Swamy. \u201cIn the worst case, assuming half the FII funds (by value) are impacted by this case and going by the government\u2019s estimated tax collection of Rs 40,000 crore, a four per cent impact could be felt on the NAVs (net asset values) of these funds, if the funds foot the tax bill,\u201d said an \u2018India Strategy\u2019 report on MAT by foreign brokerage firm CLSA.The report quoted Deloitte as saying only the investment entities incorporated as \u2018companies\u2019 will be impacted.", "newspaper": "Business Standard", "id": 340, "pubdate": "Mon, 20 Apr 2015 22:50:00 +0530", "title": "MAT row pushes FIIs towards P-note"}, {"content": "&#13;\n         &#13;\n    &#13;\nSoftening rural consumption and the likelihood of weak corporate earnings in the March quarter saw investors dump stocks from the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector.

The NII grew 21.9 per cent to Rs 650 crore\u00a0 highest growth over the past four quarters (since March 2014 quarter). Notably, continued traction in individual loans (up 19.3 per cent year-on-year),\u00a0 considered more stable (less risky), led loan growth even as the developer loan book contracted two per cent year-on-year in the quarter.Corporate loans form a mere 2.5 per cent of LIC HF's overall loan book.

Edited excerpts:What is your take on the country\u2019s economic prospects?India is poised for solid growth over the next couple of years. The growth is coming on a very low base. Second, there are many projects which have been awarded but the delivery or execution hasn\u2019t been there. These will pick up over the next couple of quarters. You have a declining inflation scenario, falling interest rates and low oil prices. All these will transform into a major consumption story for India.The market is highly optimistic on corporate earnings growth. Do you share that?The consensus estimates is high double-digit growth in earnings (for this financial year). Profits in the past few years have been depressed and to that extent, a sharp bounce-back is possible. So, even if the recovery is back-ended, I think the market will take that into its stride and start looking at 2016-17.How do valuations look?The market had this feeling of disappointment. A major concern was that things were not moving on the ground. At this point of time, the Nifty valuations are reasonable, not overvalued if one considers India\u2019s medium and long-term growth story.Which sectors look the most attractive?We are quite positive on banks. They are a strong play on consumption and on financial savings. We are expecting an increase in financial savings. We also like automobiles, a play on a falling interest rate, improved consumer sentiment and low oil prices. We are positive on the (information) technology sector, given recovery in the US.On which sectors do you remain underweight?We are positive but underweight on the consumer sector, given the valuations. Not so positive on real estate. We are underweight on telecom, given the competition scenario and high (spectrum)auction prices.What will be the impact of a US rate increase on the Indian market?There could be temporary turmoil in the financial market when the US raises interest rates. But I don\u2019t see major fund outflows from here. India is more comfortably placed when compared to a year before. The current account deficit and foreign exchange position is much better. India is one of the favoured of investment destinations, given the strong fundamentals and the growth orientation, compared to most other emerging markets. Large economies such as Japan and Europe are still having quantitative easing. So, that will contribute to inflows.Do you expect domestic flows to remain strong?Domestic flows, led by mutual funds, will continue to remain strong. In the insurance sector, Life Insurance Corporation is a very big player. Its investment decisions depend on a lot of factors, including divestments. We could see inflows from private sector insurers, as redemptions are expected to be lower compared to last year.What key reforms do you expect from the Union government?The government is trying to make India a better destination to do business. The recent measures like online auction of coal mines or online tracking of projects and clearances are good moves. Passage of the mining and insurance Bills are positives. There is no specific economic reform we're looking for but we want the reform process to be continuous.What are your expectations on monetary easing?The latest policy review was in line with market expectations. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has cited lack of transmission (of its rate cuts, by banks) and upside risk to inflation due to unseasonal rain.\u00a0 We will need to look at four key parameters. First, inflation in general and food inflation in particular. Second, the transmission by banks. Third, supply-side measures and further reforms by the government. Fourth, of course, is\u00a0 monetary action by the US Federal Reserve. If these factors are supportive, we expect one more rate cut in 2015.Outlook on the debt market?The latest RBI policy review was, more or less, accommodative. Also, the net issuances (by the government) this year will be less compared to last year. So, broadly, we expect the 10-year government security to remain in the range of 7.7-7.9 per cent for some time. Depending on the incoming data, we can see small rallies.", "newspaper": "Business Standard", "id": 343, "pubdate": "Mon, 20 Apr 2015 22:47:00 +0530", "title": "Nifty valuations are reasonable: Sanjay Kumar"}, {"content": "&#13;\n         &#13;\n    The market has now fallen for five sessions in a row due to poor global cues and local worries about MAT.

The fall has been top-heavy with large cap index stocks losing more ground. The last few sessions have been low volume.We have some sense of direction and benchmark levels to watch. A nine per cent correction from 9,119 (peak March 4) to 8,269 (low on March 27), was followed by a seven per cent recovery to 8,844 (peak on April 15), and the current downtrend has seen a correction of 4.4 per cent to 8,448 (low April 20).Obviously, the short-term trend is negative. The intermediate trend could be negative, or it could be sideways. There have been declining peaks. On the upside, the resistance at 8,840-8,850 was tested but not broken. So the next peak would have to beat 8,850 to confirm that the intermediate trend has improved.On the downside, the Nifty is still above its previous intermediate bottom of 8,269. The 200-day moving average is around 8,230-8,250 so that zone of 8,200-8,275 is key support. If the Nifty drops below that zone, it would not only confirm an intermediate downtrend; it could call the long-term bull market into question. \u00a0This entire zone has been heavily traded and there is congestion at every 50-point interval. Hence, there will be strong supports and resistances. If the market does fall below 8,200, it will probably trigger another burst of serious selling. \u00a0The domestic triggers from here on could be complex and hard to assess. There are Q4 results of course, on the domestic front. Plus, Parliament is in session and that could mean unpredictable news-based triggers in either direction. Also, a resolution of the MAT demands on FIIs would mean the return of some optimism and positive sentiment.&#13;\n\t&#13;\nOn the external front, the possibility of a Greek exit or a debt default is rising. There are worries about China's housing market. That could cause sudden panic. The Sterling, and UK equity and bond markets could all be very volatile as Britain heads into elections. \u00a0Given trade data (falling exports) the rupee looks over-valued. It fell on Monday as FII sold. RBI may want to nudge it down further to stimulate exports. However, crude prices have also spiked up considerably in the last 10 sessions and that could be cause for some worry. \u00a0If TCS' results are any indicator, the IT industry may not have done very well in Q4. That would definitely impact sentiment negatively. If Infosys has poor results, there could be serial hammering of IT stocks as the results come in. The Bank Nifty has crashed out of the range of 18,500-19,000, which it traded last week. The financial index hit 18,100 and it could fall further.The Nifty's put-call ratios (PCR) are in negative territory. The 3-month and one-month PCRs are at around 0.95 and 0.89, respectively. The April Call chain has open interest (OI) peaking at 9,000c, with reasonable OI till 8,500c.\u00a0The April Put OI is ample between 8,000p and 8,500p with peaks at 8,000p and 8,500p.\u00a0The index was held at 8,448 with the futures at 8,470. The April Call chain is 8,500c \u00a0(75) \u00a08,600c (40), 8,700c (19), 8,800c (9) etc. The Put chain is 8,200p (19), 8,300p (35), \u00a08,400p (64), 8,500p (107), etc.A bullspread of long April 8,500c, Short 8,600c costs 35, with a maximum payoff of 65.

He did not disappoint. While the self-deprecating humour was intact, the delivery had become smoother with the confidence that comes from practice. Starting with his customary disclaimer about how his views should not be construed as of the regulator, Saran quipped, \u201cWhat is a regulator without a disclaimer?\u201d, loosening up the audience of company secretaries, organised by their institute\u2019s Northern India Regional Council.He went on to recall an incident from his life to demonstrate how there could be a generation gap in perception of the concept of evaluation. Once Saran was nominated for a premier forex training program and there was a discussion in the family about handling his absence for three weeks.\u00a0 Saran\u2019s father, who was visiting, was incensed and asked, \u201cWhat kind of person you are? Even at 40, you need to be trained?\u201dSimilarly, though the present generation of board members gets offended at the mention of evaluation, that would change over the years, the regulator said. \u00a0He then took a futuristic dive, saying one approach for the board could be to work the way Google Car operated. A Google Car navigates itself by collecting huge amounts of data through censors and GPS, and evaluates all the hurdles that come in the way of its goal. Similarly, a board should see whether what it is doing is taking the company towards its goal.For the next important point, Saran borrowed from Lewis Carroll\u2019s evergreen Alice in Wonderland. \u201cWould you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?\u201d Alice asked the Cheshire cat. \u201cThat depends a good deal on where you want to get to,\u201d replied the cat.\u00a0 Boards should be clear on where they want to go, Saran said.Former Sebi chief M Damodaran, who spoke after Saran, said he would have been happy to have him as a colleague, regretting his own term had ended before the latter joined Sebi. Damodaran didn't pull punches on his pet hate, the new Companies Act, which he termed a joke. Picking on Saran\u2019s reference to Alice, the former IAS officer said, \u201cYou wanted to take people to heaven but paved a path that took everyone straight to hell.\u201d Being a consultant and member of many boards himself, the former regulator also added to Saran\u2019s point on how one should be careful while hiring consultants.Saran said there were two ways using consultants. One was the lazy way of hiring them to only tick the boxes.\u00a0 The other way to use a consultant is the way Bollywood star Aamir Khan uses his physical trainer, Mickey Mehta. Before each film, Khan decides how he wants to look for the particular role \u2014 whether to beef-up like in Ghajni\u00a0 or look like a college student. He then seeks Mehta\u2019s help in achieving that look. Saran asked boards to learn from Aamir Khan because, \u201cWe all want to make an excellent film at the end of it.\u201d", "newspaper": "Business Standard", "id": 345, "pubdate": "Mon, 20 Apr 2015 22:43:00 +0530", "title": "Board lessons from Google Car, Alice and Aamir Khan"}, {"content": "&#13;\n         &#13;\n    &#13;\nRoad toll collection company MEP Infrastructure Developers and cinema distribution and advertising firm UFO Moviez are planning to launch Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) this month.

The reason for their hope this Tritiya is said to be the lower price of gold and removal of import controls on it, with the resulting improvement in sentiment. Gold\u2019s price here is 9.9 per cent less than a year before. Last year, demand was relatively depressed at a price of nearly Rs 30,000 per 10g and stiff import controls.Bachhraj Bamalwa, director at the All India Gems and Jewellery Trade Federation said (he\u2019s based in Kolkata): \u201cWe expect a 15-20 per cent jump in gold demand compared to last year\u2019s Akshaya Tritiya. Demand is much better is south India.\u201d He also quoted experts tracking nakshatra (stars as in Hindu astrological belief) movements to say Tuesday would be an especially good occasion to buy gold.&#13;\n\t&#13;\nIn 2013, around this occasion, gold import and demand were so robust that it became a ground for the government to curb imports. The trend suggests whenever the price is lower, demand goes up. This season, a similar high demand is expected. Last month\u2019s gold import was 121 tonnes, compared to 48.5 tonnes in March 2014. This month might see 90 tonnes of import.Jewellers are considered to be importing more due to Akhshaya Tritiya and marriage season demand.Somasundaram P R, managing Director (India), World Gold Council, said: \u201cBuying behaviour is returning to normalcy, following a reduction of the import curbs and with the expectation of a duty cut in the (Union) Budget not being met. Gold is, therefore, set to start shining more brightly this Akshaya Tritiya. Notwithstanding unseasonal rains impacting the rural economy this season, gold demand is expected to be strong in 2015, on the back of a resilient economy, surging ahead with higher growth.\u201dBrokers and analysts are advising people to remain cautious on gold investment, looking at the price outlook; however, jewellers are optimistic. Angel Commodities advises investors in its special report for this Tritiya, \u201cto buy gold in a staggered manner rather than concentrate all your purchases at one go. One should take the benefit of value cost averaging to invest in gold\u201d.Yet, March gold import data suggests \u201cimport of higher purities, 100g bars, largely destined for manufacture of investment coins and bars, are rising. Interestingly, we have noticed that the majority of these are directed to Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, followed by Gujarat and Karnataka,\u201d said Sudheesh Nambiath, senior analyst, precious metals, GFMS Thomson Reuters.He says the southern market is looking more attractive for sales this Tritiya.A leading Mumbai jeweller said the new provision in the Budget on quoting one\u2019s PAN (income tax card) number for any purchase of over Rs 1 lakh in cash could impact jewellery demand this time. However, as mentioned earlier, import data on inflow of high-purity gold for making coins and bars for investment purchases suggest otherwise. The lower gold price suggests a 40-50g bar purchase can still be made around Rs 1 lakh by paying cash, which should not hurt demand, said a market veteran. High-purity gold\u2019s import is estimated at 25 tonnes, almost a fourth of the inflow in March for the domestic market.", "newspaper": "Business Standard", "id": 348, "pubdate": "Mon, 20 Apr 2015 22:33:00 +0530", "title": "Jewellers expect good sales on 'Akhshaya Tritiya'"}, {"content": "&#13;\n         &#13;\n    &#13;\nEyeing better sales on this year\u2019s Akshaya Tritiya, organised retail players here are trying to lure customers with special offers and discounts.&#13;\nEyeing better sales on this year\u2019s Akshaya Tritiya, organised retail players here are trying to lure customers with special offers and discounts.Thanks to lower prices, Akshaya Tritiya would lure more customers to the showrooms this year, said B A Ramesh, joint managing director, Thangamayil Jewellers.Retailers in Tamil Nadu expect robust sales, including the advanced bookings on Akshaya Tritiya, which is considered an auspicious day to buy new jewellery.

The surge in Brazilian exports in a global surplus situation and low prices, is standing in the way of India selling sugar in the world market. This is in spite of New Delhi belatedly sanctioning an export subsidy of Rs 4,000 a tonne to improve the cash flows of sugar factories, so that they could settle parts of their alarmingly high cane dues.The other consideration for subsidy grant was to facilitate export of 1.4 million tonnes (mt), which would go some way in reducing overflowing inventories with factories, improving local market sentiment. However, with popular May futures for raw sugar trading on the Intercontinental Exchange in New York at close to one-third of their 2011 prices, India does not stand a chance to export unless government trading houses such as STC and MMTC undertake the task. But their procurement of sugar should ideally pay for factory production cost. In any case, the government, not perceived as particularly farmer-friendly, is not betraying any urgency to bail out cane growers and factories.Currency devaluation has created ideal conditions for Brazil, Russia and Ukraine to profit from exports. For example, the Brazilian real is down 20 per cent against the dollar since the start of the year. Real has hit a decadal low because of concerns about the economy and surfacing of evidence of corruption in awarding government contracts, particularly concerning oil. What does this degree of Brazilian currency depreciation mean for the country's sugar sector? As Financial Times points out, \"Compared with a year ago, sugar prices have slumped 32 per cent in dollar terms, while in Brazilian real terms, it has only declined three per cent.\" It's a win-win situation for Brazilian factories as cane bills, the major cost component of sugar production and wages, are all settled in the local currency, while the sweetener export is denominated in dollar.Brazil, the world's largest manufacturer and exporter of sugar, has an unbeatable level of production efficiency. This is because of the operational size of each group, cane crop harvesting mechanisation, high sugar content in cane and flexibility in allocating the crop between sugar and biofuel ethanol production, depending on which of the two finds favour with the market in a season. According to a major Sao Paulo-based industry consultant, the Brazilian sugar season that began this month, the centre-south of the country, accounting for a major part of the crop, is likely to see cane crushing go up by 2.6 per cent to 585 mt. This will result in greater export thrust. India and Thailand, whose currencies have managed to hold ground against the dollar, face an uphill task in selling sugar abroad, says industry official O P Dhanuka. A strengthening dollar is more than sustaining sugar value in local currency terms for Brazil.To go by a Bloomberg survey of analysts, sugar prices have not bottomed yet. Expect these to fall to 12.02 cents a pound by July. Alarmingly for India, where 50 million growers are engaged in cane cultivation and another few million working in factories and the tertiary sector, sugar is destined to remain among the worst-performing of 22 items tracked by the Bloomberg Commodity Index. The International Sugar Organisation and some research agencies have forecast that global supply will exceed demand for five years in a row during the season to end in September 2015.When the world will be holding season-ending stocks of about 80 mt, pressure on prices will be intense. Dhanuka says world production is staying high when there is no sugar demand growth in developed countries, mainly on account of health concerns. Moreover, sugar faces high tariff barrier, in the US and European countries continue to provide subsidy to beet growers. These are instances of protecting the interest of local farmers. Nearly 80 per cent of world sugar is derived from cane and the rest from beet. The absence of government support in surplus management and administration of the sugar exim trade have left Indian farmers and factories in a quandary.&#13;\n\t\t\t\tBITTERSWEET&#13;\n\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSugar exports from Brazil, the world's largest manufacturer and exporter of the commodity, is set to increase further&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCurrency devaluation has created an ideal condition for Brazil to profit from exports&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis could dent the prospects of India's sugar sector, shrinking the margins of local producers&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn India, sugar is likely to remain among the worst performing commodities&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWith end-of-season stocks estimated at 80 mt, it could put further pressure on prices&#13;\n\t\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t", "newspaper": "Business Standard", "id": 350, "pubdate": "Mon, 20 Apr 2015 22:31:00 +0530", "title": "Real's depreciation lends edge to Brazilian sugar export"}, {"content": "&#13;\n         &#13;\n    NIFTYCurrent: 8,448 (fut: 8,470)Target: NA&#13;\nStop-loss short positions at 8,530.

The improvement in demand during the second half of 2014 (37 per cent volume growth when compared to H2 CY13 and 19 per cent yoy growth during the fourth quarter) was supported by improving consumer sentiments, with the volumes reaching historical high of 662 tonnes, despite H1 being weaker than estimates. Over the near term, credit rating agency ICRA expects improvement in gold availability coupled with the re-introduction of low cost gold metal loans, rising consumer sentiments and aggressive store expansion by organized retailers to drive volume growth. ICRA expects jewellery demand growth to be around 10 per cent during the current year, supported by recent regulatory reliefs for the industry.Over the long term, gold jewellery demand in India is supported by cultural underpinnings in India, evolving lifestyle and growing disposable income, especially in tier 2 , tier 3 and rural markets which account for a major chunk of the demand. ICRA expects the domestic gold jewellery industry to record robust growth of around 8-10 per cent over the medium to long term, aided by the growing penetration of the organised sector.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), during the previous fiscal relaxed all extant restrictions on import of gold and funding for jewellers, including withdrawal of the 20/80 scheme and the re-introduction of metal loans. The relaxation of restrictions provided a fillip to the industry, which was recording lower than expected volumes (during H1 CY14). In terms of supply, imports over the medium term are expected to reach the levels witnessed prior to the curbs, largely replacing sourcing of gold through the unofficial channels or recycled gold.ICRA's analysis of store level metrics including same store sales growth, EBITDA and revenue per square feet for eight leading players indicates that a majority of these indicators have witnessed a moderation in FY14 and early FY15 (impacted by weak demand sentiments and rising competitive pressures).However, with the improving demand prospects and easing up of the operating environment, ICRA estimates a growth in the range of 4-8 per cent for several of the aforementioned parameters.", "newspaper": "Business Standard", "id": 352, "pubdate": "Mon, 20 Apr 2015 20:57:00 +0530", "title": "Jewellery demand to grow by 10% in 2015 : Report"}, {"content": "&#13;\n         &#13;\n    &#13;\nCompanies are required to inform shareholders of their annual general meetings 21 days before the event.&#13;\nCompanies are required to inform shareholders of their annual general meetings 21 days before the event.But shareholders who watch the exchange website for this information may not always get this three weeks notice, according to Shriram Subramanian, managing director of InGovern Research Services.While some companies make an exchange disclosure, others don't.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tThis problem related to non-uniform disclosure standards by companies on issues such as the important dates (as above); as well as material developments such as getting large orders or trading in securities by insiders is likely to be addressed with finality by the regulator.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tThis year, the Securities and Exchange Board of India is planning to revamp its disclosure requirements to apply a uniform standard to all companies, reduce the number of times certain disclosures are made as well as introduce systems for 'automatically gathering and integrating' information from companies.In fact, disclosures form one of the key areas of focus for the regulator, with a revamped regime likely to be introduced in the current financial year, according to Sebi's last board meeting minutes.&#13;\n&#13;\n\t\"The focus during the year 2015-16 will be on implementation of corporate governance standards by listed entities and system based disclosures,\" it said.&#13;\n&#13;\n\t\"What is material information is liberally interpreted.

Reliance Industries had moved from a low of Rs 796.75 to a high of Rs 943.80 ove15 days in anticipation of good results. The company obliged by declaring slightly better than expected numbers. But post results, the stock has taken a beating and fallen by nearly 4.3% to Rs 886.30.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tDespite an impressive performance by Reliance, which was applauded by the analysts, why did the stock fall?&#13;\n&#13;\n\tThe devil is in the details. The stellar performance posted by Reliance was largely on account of gross refining margin touching $10.10 per barrel. But these numbers are unlikely to be repeated in future. HDFC Securities in its result analysis say that they do not expect the GRM pop to last long and foresee a fall as product demand eases in the face of sluggish global demand. Kotak Securities expects refining margins for FY16 to be in the range of $8.6-8.7 per barrel, which is the same as in FY15.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tAnalysts are building up a bull case on Reliance based on the commissioning of new capacity worth $25 billion that the company will commission. The company\u2019s net fixed assets have increased from Rs 2.33 trillion to Rs 3.18 trillion over the past year, with more to be added in the current year.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tHowever, it is the immediate future that is not as rosy. Production from Reliance\u2019s oil and gas business continues to fall. With gas prices being cut in India and global gas prices, especially shale gas, stalling at lower levels, analysts are not expecting better numbers from this division. In the March 2015 quarter, though the company posted a 9.3% volume growth, revenue fell 48.1%. Reliance has planned to arrest the decline in production but awaits key approvals from the government, including budget approvals for capital expenditure.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tIts telecom initiative \u2013 Reliance Jio \u2013 is another cause for concern. Even after the launch, the division is expected to break even at the EBIDTA level after three years. Capital employed in the business has already increased from Rs 37,800 crore in March 2014 to Rs 52,400 crore in March 2015. Kotak Securities, in arriving at its target price for RIL, has given a nil value for its telecom as well as shale business.&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n\tIn other words, almost 50% of the group\u2019s gross capital employed is not generating any returns.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tLakhotia added that the investment in telecom, which in future will be 25% of the capital employed, is what is worrying the market. Lack of clarity on the timing of launch and its strategy is causing anxious moments for investors. Unless the company launches its telecom services and analysts are able to see traction in its subscriber base, anxiety over the stock is expected to continue.&#13;\n", "newspaper": "Business Standard", "id": 354, "pubdate": "Mon, 20 Apr 2015 17:12:00 +0530", "title": "The real reason why Reliance stock has taken a beating despite strong earnings"}, {"content": "&#13;\n         &#13;\n    &#13;\nBenchmark share indices extended losses for the fourth straight session registering their biggest single-day drop in 3 weeks amid broad based sell-off with index heavyweight Reliance Industries leading the decline.

It made 2.5 million loans in the UK in 2014, compared with 3.7 million in 2013, while total customer numbers in the UK fell from about one million to 575,000.Chairman Andy Haste, who arrived last summer, said: \"We said Wonga would be smaller and less profitable in the near term as we focus on creating a sustainable business that lends responsibly and transparently to customers who can afford to borrow from us.\"We know it will take time to repair our reputation and gain an accepted place in the financial services industry.\"Wonga, along with other payday lenders, now faces strict new rules from the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which ruled that customers must face stricter affordability checks. The regulator said it expected a large number of payday loan operators to exit the market as a result. Wonga said the new regulations had led to a 12% rise in operating costs. Lenders are no longer allowed to roll over a loan more than twice, nor attempt to reclaim payment from a borrower's account more than twice. There is also a cap on the cost of lending in the UK.Wonga's rate of defaults on loans by struggling borrowers stood at 6.6% last year, compared with 6.9% the previous year.'Tough year'\n                        Adverts featuring puppets were cut last summer\n                    \n                Paul Miles, chief financial officer, said costs had been cut.

And found tears of hunger, fatigue, stress, annoyance, and boredom look quite different.Conducting hospital tests, in Barcelona, Mexico City, and Seoul, he found a computer programme could distinguish the cause of distress from the waveform, and get it right, on average 95% of the time.Hunger produces energetic, sharp shouts. Fatigue leads to moans. And stress, intense, short cries.Dr Monagas compares his WhyCry with having a grandparent handy, to help new parents eventually understand their babies without it.\n                        The WhyCry app can analyse your baby's cries and decode what they mean\n                    \n                It's silly to ask whether baby apps are good or bad, says Dr Dmitri Christakis, professor of paediatrics at the University of Washington and director of the Child Health Institute.And engaging technology passively, with an iPad becoming like a television, is different to interactive, slower-paced baby apps, he says.The American Academy of Pediatrics currently counsels parents to minimise or eliminate screen time for children under two.However, argues Dr Christakis, this guidance is \"dated and ill-advised\" - what about Skypeing distant grandparents, he asks?Academic research has lagged slightly behind technological development.Of the best learning-orientated baby apps, he says, \"they may very well prove to have some educational benefits, that's to be shown.\"Tech for tots is still in its infancy.

And a golf course and coffee shop.It is a business empire which under Simmons' stewardship just keeps on growing.This has led to the band's critics - and there have been many over the years - accusing the group of being too commercially-focused, of cheapening itself at the expense of its music.\n                        Kiss have authorised more than 5,000 different merchandise items\n                    \n                The calm and quietly spoken Simmons says he has no respect for such people.He says (after a liberal amount of swear words have been edited out): \"All our lives Kiss has been hounded by people who haven't achieved anything. And we buried them long ago.\"I call selling merchandise 'the Kiss business', and every band sells T-shirts, every band sells merchandise. They just don't do as good a job of it as us.\"Lifetime teetotallerThe son of a mother who survived the Holocaust, Simmons was born in the Israeli city of Haifa in 1949. His birth name was Chaim Witz.Describing his family as \"dirt poor\", he first showed his entrepreneurial spirit as a seven year old, when he and a friend started to pick wild fruit which they then sold on roadsides.\n                        Kiss have sold 100 million records despite never having been a hit with music critics\n                    \n                He says it was his first lesson in the importance of working hard and making money.The family then emigrated to the US a year later, and growing up in New York, Simmons was inspired to start a band after watching the Beatles on television.In 1973 Kiss was formed, with Simmons on bass, Paul Stanley and Ace Frehley on guitars, and Peter Criss on drums.\n                        Kiss recently moved into the coffee business\n                    \n                With Simmons and Stanley sharing the vocals, each band member painted his face with a different design, and took on a stage name.Simmons' name was \"The Demon\", and on a white background he drew black flames around his eyes. Not forgetting putting on platform boots and body armour.Fuelled by catchy hard rock songs, and the outlandish make-up and outfits giving the band a major promotional push, within a few years Kiss was enjoying soaring sales and sell-out tours.\n                        Kiss even sell birth control products, with four different types of condoms\n                    \n                The music critics were often hostile, with many accusing the group of being all image over substance, but Kiss built up a massive fan base around the world.Yet despite living a multi-million dollar lifestyle for four decades, Simmons says he has never drunk alcohol, taken drugs, or even smoked a cigarette.\"As a young man at parties, I'd look around and see all the other men completely drunk, behaving like idiots, and unable to talk to the beautiful girls,\" he says.\"What a complete waste of humanity... booze or drugs have never done anything for me, but I fully uphold people's right to have a completely loser life.\"WorkaholicAlthough original members Ace Frehley and Peter Criss are no longer in the group, Kiss continues to tour the world with Stanley as the musical leader and Simmons as the businessman.He describes his stewardship of the current world tour as like \"driving a truck\".\n                        Simmons lives in Los Angeles with former Playboy model Shannon Tweed\n                    \n                \"I'm driving and I keep an eye on everything,\" says Simmons. \"But open the hood and I don't have a clue what is going on with the engine.\"Thankfully I hire people who can do all that for me. Paul and I always have a great team with us... and every night we put on one hell of a show. We are deadly serious when up on stage.\"In addition to looking after Kiss, Simmons' other business interests now include everything from a restaurant chain, to an American football team, reality TV shows, a new horror movie production company, book and magazine publishing, public speaking, and language translation services.He says he is able to find the time for everything because he loves working, and is never hungover.\n                        Simmons says that whether on or off stage he is always working\n                    \n                \"Think about how much time most people waste doing nothing - weekends, nothing, holidays, nothing, Christmas, nothing. That all adds up.\"Me I'm always working. When I'm on tour, I'm constantly on my computer working.\"When at home, Simmons lives in Los Angeles with his long-term partner Shannon Tweed, an actress and former Playboy playmate, with whom he has two children.He says: \"I'm like [billionaire investor] Warren Buffett - he gets up every day and goes to work even though he doesn't need the money.\"I live to make more money.

The bright blue neon lights and strains of Indonesian pop music do nothing to lift the spirits of shop-owners here. Business is slow, and it's not what they're used to.For these retailers there's one central problem: the value of the currency. The rupiah has lost 10% of its value against the dollar since last year. And it's a problem that is dogging Indonesia, even while the country welcomes delegations from around the world to the World Economic Forum and the president promises stronger growth.The measures now being introduced to tackle the problem include lifting visa fees for tourists and tax changes in the hope that will lift the rupiah's value.Many store owners in Harco say they've seen their neighbours' shops close down, or go out of business because of the drastic fall in the currency. Eddie Widjaja has been running his store Edicom electronics for the last decade in Harco.\"We sell in rupiah, but we pay to the dealer in dollars, so that means our costs have effectively gone up by 20 to 25%,\" he tells me as he shows me around his small store. \"We can't increase our prices by that much, there's too much competition here in this mall. I'm not going to get involved in a price war - that's just a race to the bottom. I'm hopeful my good service will keep customers coming back.\"\n                        Shop owner Eddie Widjaja says his costs have risen by up to 25% because of the weaker rupiah\n                    \n                'Big challenge'The slowdown in sales because of the volatility in the rupiah isn't limited to laptops. Car and motorcycle sales dropped by 20% in February.South East Asia's largest economy has been struggling with the drastic decline in the rupiah, which is the worst performing currency in Asia this year. The Indonesian president Joko Widodo has said the weakening rupiah is his top concern and he has been in several meeting with economic ministers this month to discuss it. \"The weak rupiah is quite a big challenge to business,\" said Suryo Bambang Sulisto, chairman of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce. \"Just imagine if you're an importer, and you have to buy dollars to import - what will you do then? \"You're hit especially hard if you're borrowing in US dollars. Some say it's good for exporters - but not really, because a lot of exporters import their raw materials. So it hurts them too.\"\n                        Indonesia hopes its visa initiative will boost the number of tourists\n                    \n                Welcoming touristsThe government has come up with a slew of economic packages ranging from tax incentives, to a visa-free initiative in the hopes it will convince foreigners to buy more Indonesian goods, to boost the value of the rupiah.Until recently many western tourists had to pay $35 on arrival in Indonesia for a visa. But under new rules that took effect this month, many holidaymakers will be able to enter for free. The move is a bid to attract more tourists to Indonesia's tourist hot-spots like Bali and Lombok. \"In my view these six policies are only a part of a long list of policy reforms to stabilize the rupiah,\" says Wijayanto Samirin, the Indonesian vice president's special economic advisor. \"The tourist policy has worked for other countries like Malaysia and Thailand. We currently get 9 million tourists a year - Malaysia gets 27 million a year. \"Assuming one tourist brings $1,000 - imagine how much money will be spent here - and what impact that would have on our rupiah. \"If we can make it easy (for people to come here) then we should expect a flood of tourists from abroad, and a flood of money too.\"\n                        The rupiah's depreciation has shaken many Indonesians\n                    \n                There appears to be no impact yet though - although the policies have already come into practice. The currency is still trading at more than 12,900 rupiah to the US dollar - nearing decade lows.  Investors' concernsBut some experts say the measures may not have an immediate or the desired impact and are not addressing the fundamental problems which are undermining the rupiah's value.\"The current volatility in the Indonesian rupiah is down to three factors,\" says Ben Bingham of the IMF, \"the strength of the US dollar, political uncertainty and an unfriendly business environment - shoddy infrastructure and an inefficient bureaucracy.\"There's nothing Indonesia can do about the first factor, but it can certainly work towards improving the others.\"In Harco, store-owners close up after another dismal day of sales. The gloomy faces on many of the shopkeepers underline just how precarious the economy has become. While Indonesia's economic environment is still strong, the rupiah's depreciation has shaken many Indonesians. It is a psychological barometer of how well this country is doing. Over the last decade Indonesia has been heralded as a comeback kid - and a strong and stable rupiah was part of that story. Any prolonged instability will be seen as a sign of weakness - and a cause for concern amongst even the most confident of Indonesia's investors. \n    ", "newspaper": "BBC", "id": 380, "pubdate": "Tue, 21 Apr 2015 03:04:30 +0530", "title": "Indonesia grapples with weak rupiah"}, {"content": "With an estimated $4 trillion (\u00a32.7tn) of foreign reserves stashed away in various sovereign wealth funds, China has plenty of cash to splash.Despite the recent slowdown in the country's GDP, most developed economies would dream of an annual growth rate of 7%.No wonder then that annual Chinese investment overseas has grown eightfold over the past 10 years to reach more than $140bn in 2013. Somewhat surprisingly, there was a modest slowdown in 2014, with investment in the first half lower than a year earlier, largely due to a fall in spending on energy projects.But this dip is likely to be short lived, for the simple reason that population growth and, more importantly, the exploding middle classes mean China's voracious appetite for resources will continue to grow.The US has been the largest recipient of Chinese money over the past decade, largely due to a burst of investment since 2012 - this time last year, Australia was the number one destination over the previous 10 years.In the first half of last year, however, investment in the UK matched that in the US, as it cemented its place as China's favourite European country to invest in - at $24bn it received more than double France's $11bn.China has made investments and signed contracts all over the world, but Africa in particular has piqued its interest. China, the world's second largest economy, has done business in 34 African countries, with Nigeria top of the pile at $21bn. Ethiopia and Algeria have attracted more than $15bn, with Angola and South Africa each drawing in almost $10bn.The reason is simply Africa's wealth of natural resources.At the other end of the scale, political tensions help explain why China has invested almost as much in Mongolia ($1.4bn) as it has in Japan ($1.6bn), the country it recently overtook in the league of the world's most powerful economies.Resources are what China needs, particularly to meet demand for energy that is predicted to triple by 2050.That is why investment in energy has dwarfed that in other sectors since 2005, with almost $400bn committed to securing power for China's population, which currently stands at almost 1.4 billion.Investment in energy actually dipped slightly last year, with that in other areas such as transportation, property and technology taking up much of the slack. Energy investments tend to be large-scale and dominated by state-owned companies, so the temporary lull has meant less state and more private investment. In some cases, this makes Chinese money more palatable to host countries. Metals are another key area of investment, as these are needed in construction and industry to help fuel China's rapidly expanding economy.The Chinese state has made some staggeringly large investments in individual companies and projects, most of which are, unsurprisingly, in the energy sector.CNOOC, for example, spent $15bn on Canada's Nexen in 2013, while other state-owned energy companies have wracked up multi-billion dollar deals in recent years.Outside of energy and resources, finance has also attracted some serious money, with Morgan Stanley and Standard Bank the biggest recipients of Chinese cash.Biggest investments by company, 2005-presentCompany\nCountry\nSector\nInvestor\n US$bn\n% share\nNexen\nCanada\nEnergy\nCNOOC\n15.1\nN/A\nRio Tinto\nAustralia\nMetals\nChinalco\n12.8\n11\nAdaz Petroleum\nSwitzerland\nEnergy\nSinopec\n7.2\n100\nRepsol\nBrazil\nEnergy\nSinopec\n7.1\n40\nSmithfield Foods\nUS\nAgriculture\nShuanghui\n7.1\n100\nGlencore\nPeru\nMetals\nMinmetal\n5.85\nN/A\nStandard Bank\nSouth Africa\nFinance\nICBC\n5.6\n20\nBP and South Iraq Oil\nIraq\nEnergy\nCNPC\n5.59\n37\nKasMunaiGas National\nKazakhstan\nEnergy\nCNPC\n5.3\n8\nMorgan Stanley\nUS\nFinance\nCIC\n5\n10\nGalp Energia\nBrazil\nEnergy\nSinopec\n4.8\n30\nConocoPhillips\nCanada\nEnergy\nSinopec\n4.65\n9\nSource: Heritage Foundation/American Enterprise InstituteThey may not represent the same kind of outlay, but China has also invested in some household names across the world, from IBM and Barclays to Ford and General Motors.In percentage terms they may not add up to much, but they still represent a hefty outlay in dollar terms.

Lucky to get \u00a350,\" says George.\n                        Y264 TKP's place in the family album\n                    \n                George sits in his office outside the tiny Cornish village of Doublebois and patiently explains the macroeconomic forces at play that have reduced my car to a hunk of worthless metal.China, he reckons, is the problem. With Chinese demand falling, the price of iron ore is on the way down and scrap metal prices are following in their wake.A year ago George could have got \u00a3160 for my car.  During the Beijing Olympics prices skyrocketed. Not now. \"There's a worldwide glut of metal,\" he explains.\n                        Death of Y264 TKP - snapped on its way to the scrap merchant\n                    \n                And Y264 TKP is 75% metal, albeit dented and scratched by bike racks, my mother's gate post and, for reasons too complex to go into, the teeth of a small pony. 'Bloody painful'There are other problems too - the collapse in demand, unsurprisingly, from Ukraine, and the eurozone recession.One insider put it bluntly: \"The business is bloody painful\".Charles Ambrose of the UK's Motor Vehicle Dismantlers' Association (MVDA) said: \"In the last few years we've lost 30 members or so going out of business. Most of them are long term players. They are being kicked from all sides.\"George will bear away poor crippled Y264 TKP to be eviscerated in an \"authorised treatment facility\". It will be \"de-polluted\", the battery, and tyres removed, the diesel, oils, and brake fluids sucked out. \n                        The metal is the easy bit - an end-of-life vehicle on its way to a new life.\n                    \n                The oils will be re-refined or used as fuel. The battery will be ground down, the acid neutralised, the polymers separated from the lead, to go towards making a new one.Black marketOf course, I could bypass George altogether and get a little more - cash in hand - from someone, er, less respectable.The MVDA believes 600,000 of the 1.7 million cars scrapped every year simply fall off the official radar, unregistered, untaxed. The paper trail vanishes into a black hole, or rather a black market. Environmental niceties are not observed on the black market. But the expense of putting anything in a landfill in the UK and the difficulty of dumping cars means even the vanished ones work their way back into the recycling system. \"It's hard to know exactly where those cars go,\" says Mr Ambrose. \"We know a tremendous number are broken up and the parts end up on eBay. \"Others are exported as whole cars or as spare parts. Parts of your car could end up in a vehicle in Nigeria. That's not a problem environmentally. It's still recycling. \"But the money involved in this kind of black market is often also involved in crime.\"The plastic bitsSo one way or another almost 95% of Y264 TKP will be recycled. The UK is expected to hit the 95% car recycling target set by the European Union's end-of-life vehicle directive this year or next.\n                        This Nespresso machine could once have been your car... well, maybe not the whole car, perhaps the front door arm rest.\n                    \n                Which is why the plastic bits of Y264 TKP, like the cup-holders stuffed with my daughters' hair-ties, will not go to landfill. The legislation has forced industry to come up with recycling solutions - at a cost.Ian Hetherington, director general of the British Metals Recycling Association says: \"The capital expenditure to develop this kind of technology is very high indeed, and it is only profitable when you are producing very high quality plastics at the end of it.\"So the American firm MBA Polymers invested $30m (\u00a320m) to develop technology to recycle high grade plastics.Its joint venture with the UK's European Metal Recycling (EMR) in Worksop recycles 80,000 tonnes of plastic every year. The plastic pellets are then sold to manufacturers.The alarming truth is the plastic trim of Y264 TKP, which the dog did such appalling things to on the way home from Scotland in 2008, could end up as part of a Nespresso coffee machine. Squeezed marginsBut plastic, like metal, is subject to market prices. It is the low oil price this time. Cheap oil makes \"virgin\" plastic cheaper, so while the law insists on recycling, the margins for the recycled stuff are squeezed.Then there is the fluff - the padding, the upholstery, and probably the shoe my son lost in 2007. Technically it is ASR, or automobile shredder residue. There is a good chance it will go to landfill.But there is also a chance it may go through another innovation - a new energy-from-waste plant in Oldbury, in the West Midlands where Chinook Sciences and EMR will turn it into electricity to be sold into the grid. The grubby left over bits of Y264 TKP will then power, say, my washing machine. Finally there's the metal - the easy bit, even if its value is small. Urban miningY264 TKP, replete with my memories, will go into a crusher, something like the Red Giant made by the New York firm Hammel, or perhaps even the monstrous Hammel 1500DK  that will devour a car body in around 20 seconds.The parts are then separated, using magnets and flotation tanks to divide materials according to their atomic weights. This is the law of the scrap dealer: Separation creates value. There are precious metals to be had: rhodium, palladium and platinum, and rare earth metals, once discarded, now picked clean from mirrors, batteries and catalytic converters.\n                        Awaiting rebirth...as part of a middle eastern office block?\n                    \n                Some call it \"Urban Mining\".  One recycling expert described it thus: \"The iron ore miners take the stuff from below the ground, we just take it from above the ground.\"The steel will probably go abroad for smelting. Scrap is best suited for electric arc-furnaces rather than blast furnaces, and the most convenient ones are in southern Europe. Turkey is the favoured destination. From there, the metamorphosed chassis of Y264 TKP, possibly still tainted with the last few grains of sand from a Norfolk beach holiday, is likely to end up as a small (but I like to think important) part of the frame of a middle eastern skyscraper.Ian Hetherington adds a final suggestion: \"It may though actually go back to South Korea. \"It could even turn into another Hyundai.\"\n    ", "newspaper": "BBC", "id": 382, "pubdate": "Sat, 18 Apr 2015 02:32:33 +0530", "title": "The death and rebirth of Y264 TKP"}, {"content": "\n                        Not all phones go to heaven: Increasing ownership of electronic gadgetry means piles of toxic e-waste grow around the world.\n                    \n                Getting rid of old electronics can be a hassle when you don't know what to do with them.Wisconsin teenager Joshua Furlano decided to do something about it. As a project for high school, he organised an e-waste drive with a nearby recycling company in his hometown, West Salem, and raised nearly $1,000 (\u00a3671) for a local charity. \"Many people don't know what to do with the old electronics. The event prevents people from throwing the old electronics in landfills but instead recycling them properly,\" says Mr Furlano, who gathered up over 6,000lbs (2,720kg) worth of e-waste.\"The turnout for the event was a bit of a surprise. I [didn't] have much advertising before so I did not believe there would be a large turnout. From the start of the event I already had three to four cars lined up in the parking lot,\" he adds.The success of grassroots events like this highlights the fact that many of us are still unsure what to do with our old devices.\n                        Gathering old electrical items for Joshua Furlano's recycling drive in West Salem, Wisconsin\n                    \n                \n                        Events like this help remind people to recycle - but it takes industrial plants to deal with the quantities produced\n                    \n                Garbage pail kidsAccording to the UN, the world produced 50 million tons of electronic waste in 2012. That's an average of 15lbs (6.8kg) per person. The constant pressure to upgrade smartphones to the newest model leaves countless older devices on the scrap heap.  Here a motley crew of toxins including lead, mercury, cadmium, and barium can leach from electronic components into  the environment.Add the proliferation of fitness trackers, tablets and wearables like the Apple Watch, and we're wearing and carrying more electronics than ever before - all of which will one day be obsolete.This has inevitably led to the rise of the e-waste management industry. A report earlier this year from Allied Market Research predicts it will be worth $49.4bn by 2020.Major tech companies are doing their bit too. Apple is now accepting non-iPhones like Android and Windows Phone devices to its reuse and recycle program in the US, Canada, UK, France, Italy, and Germany.Other big companies offering a similar scheme include Kyocera, which even provides free shipping labels. \n                        It's not only mobile phones - this man in India is dismantling discarded printers and hard drives\n                    \n                Where there's muckSeveral companies and start-ups have spotted an opportunity. India's BinBag describes itself as the Uber of recycling. The Bangalore-based start-up has been in operation for just over six months and has already gathered two tons of e-waste, according to founder and chief executive Achitra Borgohain. \"We have a web platform where people that want to dispose of their waste can log in and get picked up\" says Mr Borgohain. \"We typically get stuff like old PCs, old cell phones.\"\n                        BinBag founder Achitra Borgohain (left)\n                    \n                Unlike other companies, BinBag doesn't actually own any recycling plants. Mr Borgohain say it is \"only solving the last mile\" for the customer by connecting them with recyclers.E-waste, and waste disposal in general in India has been a particular problem for government, which is drafting new rules to prevent dumping on the streets.There is also the issue of informal recyclers - illegal businesses with low-paid workers, collecting electronics to break down and sell for parts. Safety precautions to protect workers are often non-existent, as are measures to prevent pollution.BinBag's aim is to link people up with legitimate recyclers through its notification system.

Spot gold was little changed at $1,203.11 an ounce by 0653 GMT, after earlier dipping to a session low of $1,198.65. \"Gold is closely tracking the U.S. dollar at the moment. There isn't any big economic data so investors are following the Greek drama,\" said Ronald Leung,  chief dealer at Lee Cheong Gold Dealers in Hong Kong. A strong rally in  stock markets was also keeping investors out of gold, Leung said. Japanese shares rose to a 15-year high on Wednesday on expectations of improved corporate earnings. Gold, often seen as a safe-haven investment, tends to see a drop in demand when  equities are doing well. The dollar eased against a basket of major currencies on Wednesday after putting in a mixed performance overnight. Greece, which is quickly running out of cash, pledged to its eurozone partners in February that by the end of April it would agree with creditors on a comprehensive list of reforms to get 7.2 billion euros remaining from its bailout. But no package will be ready by Friday, when eurozone ministers are to meet in  Riga, and it was also unlikely that one would be ready by the end of the month, according to a  senior eurozone official. Prolonged uncertainty over the debt crisis - which if unresolved could see  Greece exiting the euro zone - could boost demand for bullion, seen as a safe haven, although the resulting strength in the dollar could limit gains. In a reflection of investor sentiment,  SPDR Gold Trust , the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, said its holdings rose 0.45 percent to 742.35 tonnes on Tuesday. Traders were also monitoring activity in the physical markets. India, the top  bullion consumer, celebrated the gold-buying festival of Akshaya Tritiya on Tuesday.

Now, however, after investors have flung billions of dollars into small  stocks and small stock  mutual funds over the past several months, the \"small is beautiful\" strategy's shortcomings are becoming apparent. First, the rally made many of the members of the small cap Russell 2000 index expensive. Secondly, not all small firms offer the high degree of immunity from the strong dollar's negative effect on U.S. exporters that investors expect. \"It's very simple to say small cap is domestically focused, they are going to hold up better than large cap because of the currency,\" says Bank of America Merrill Lynch small-cap strategist  Steven DeSanctis. \"That is not always the case.\" Some small firms generate as much of their sales overseas as their bigger rivals and might be even more exposed than large corporations that have hedging programs and operations spread across multiple markets to cushion the impact. Other act as suppliers to big players that suffer from the dollar rally or compete against imports that have become cheaper. Some may simply face other headwinds such as energy companies hurt by the slide in crude prices. In fact, during the previous spell of dollar strength from 1995 to 2002 small stocks underperformed large caps by 4.8 percent as investors, rattled by the Asian currency crisis, chose more liquid and less volatile assets, according to an analysis by DeSanctis. If the Federal Reserve sparks another flight to safety with an interest rate hike, small stocks could again suffer, especially given their already high valuations, DeSanctis said. Russell 2000 stocks now trade at 24.4 times earnings compared with 17.1 for the large cap S&amp;P 500, according to  Thomson Reuters data. LOSERS AMONG WINNERS So far in 2015, the dollar has risen 8.3 percent and the Russell 2000 - made up of companies with less than $4 billion in market capitalization - has rallied 5 percent, more than double the 1.8 percent increase in the S&amp;P 500. In March, retail investors put $1.7 billion into small cap mutual funds and exchange traded funds, while they pulled $11.9 billion out of large cap funds, according to Thomson Reuters data. But those who invested in small cap energy sector, for example, are looking at a loss of more than 44 percent since the start of July, when crude prices began heading lower, the dollar's strength playing a part in the slide. Examples of companies that rely on overseas markets also underscore the need for caution. Helicopter manufacturer  Erickson Inc, which generated more than 60 percent of its 2014 revenue outside of  North America and depends on the oil industry for a big chunk of its business, has seen its shares tumble 45 percent so far this year. Weight Watchers, which derives over 40 percent of its business from overseas, has said it expects the strong dollar to shave roughly 15 cents a share off of its projected annual 2015 earnings of 40-70 cents a share. Its share price is down nearly 70 percent for 2015 and the company has acknowledged the growing challenge from mobile calorie counting applications. Yet other more domestically-focused weight management peers have fared better.  Nutrisystem Inc shares have held steady over the same period while Medifast Inc has slipped 7.8 percent. A spokeswoman for Weight Watchers declined to comment for the story and representatives for Erickson were unavailable to comment. To be sure, several small companies are insulated from the dollar effect and doing fine. For example, Drew Industries, a maker of components for recreational vehicles and manufactured homes, reported an almost 29 percent year-on-year rise in fourth quarter sales. Its shares are up more than 20 percent since the start of the year yet its forward price-earnings ratio of 18.3 is still well below that for the whole small-cap index. \"We are trying to focus on companies that are much more domestic oriented,\" says  Michael Corbett, chief investment officer at Perritt Capital Management in Chicago. Among his picks are several financial services companies, such as Hennessy Advisors, Silvercrest Asset Management and  Liberty Tax. But even those who cherry-pick such companies have to be aware that they are arriving late to the party. For example, Texas Roadhouse is a U.S.-focused restaurant chain, but its forward price-to-earnings ratio is near its eight-year peak just below 25. \"I wouldn't say that it shouldn't (go higher) or can't,\" says Edward Hemmelgarn,  chief investment officer of Shaker Investments in Cleveland, Ohio. \"But the price has moved up faster than the earnings have.\" ", "newspaper": "Economic Times", "id": 388, "pubdate": "Wed, 22 Apr 2015 13:04:34 +0530", "title": "As strong dollar weighs, not all small US stocks are beautiful"}, {"content": "MUMBAI: The  rupee depreciated 13 paise to hit an intraday low of 63 against the  US dollar today at  InterbankForeign Exchange.

Other pledges that need to be met include bullet trains and air-conditioned local trains in Mumbai. The institution is discussing such bonds with investment banks, three people aware of the talks told ET.Rupee-denominated bonds are seen reducing funding costs at least by 150-200 basis points compared with domestic fund-raising avenues as the exchange-rate risk is shifted to the buyers from sellers. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.IRFC managing director Rajiv Datt confirmed that it was exploring such a fund-raising plan. \"We are keen to raise rupee-denominated offshore bonds,\" he said. \"Once RBI guidelines are finalised, we may sell such securities for up to $1 billion allocated for external commercial borrowings (ECBs) this year (FY16).\"The government has mandated a total IRFC borrowing target of Rs 17,655 crore for the fiscal year, an all-time high that's about 50% higher than the previous year.This is planned to be raised through a combination of rupeedenominated bonds (through the ECB route), tax-free bonds and domestic corporate bonds.

About Rs 7.29 lakh crore will go toward capital expenditure in the same period.IRFC BOND RATINGIRFC is fully government owned and is therefore treated as a quasi-sovereign entity by investors, especially foreign portfolio managers. In the international market, IRFC bonds are at par with India's sovereign rating of BBB-, the lowest investment grade ranking. Its domestic bonds are rated AAA. IRFC had earlier asked the government for permission to float rupee-denominated bonds overseas.The instrument allows investors to participate in the Indian bond market without having to register locally.\"The only people who would be interested in this are people who don't want to come to your country and be registered as FPIs (foreign portfolio investors),\" said Hitendra Dave, managing director, head of global markets, HSBC India. \"The entire work everything gets exported out.\"IRFC last mopped up $900 million through the ECB route, including $400 million in syndicated loans and $500 million through offshore bonds in FY14.

Now he has the assignment to make Volvo the world\u2019s best trucks company,\" Gardell said.Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg, who as recently as April 1 had said he was confident in the work Persson was doing amid reports he would get the axe, said Lundstedt was being brought in to lead the next phase for Volvo. Lundstedt is a 25-year veteran at Scania, whose flexible production system modelled on the ground-breaking techniques of Toyota (7203.T) in the 1990s has helped it outpace Volvo in terms of profitability over the past decade.Lundstedt, whose easy-going manner endeared him to Scania staff and helped smooth its integration into VW, will assume his role in October, with CFO Jan Gurander serving as acting CEO in the interim. Persson meantime delivered some of the strongest earnings of his tenure, as Sweden's biggest listed company by sales and top private sector employer said adjusted operating profit rose to 4.60 billion crowns from a year-ago 2.59 billion, topping a mean forecast of 3.47 billion in Reuters poll of analysts.To placate investors who have seen Volvo shares underperform for years, it has held out the possible sale of parts of its large IT unit while selling a stake in Indian partner Eicher Motors (EICH.NS).Volvo, which also makes buses, construction equipment and boat engines, said it was looking to bring in a partner for parts of its IT business, opening the door to a deal.

Authorities said he traded from his UK home using tactics such as \"layering\" and \"spoofing,\" which traders use to place orders that they cancel before they are executed to create the false impression of demand. The U.S. Justice Department said it is requesting his extradition. There was no answer at Sarao's house in the London suburb of Hounslow on Tuesday. British police said he will appear at a London court on Wednesday. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed related civil charges.Although regulators frequently bring civil cases for alleged manipulation, especially in the world of penny stocks, proving a criminal case is much more difficult, the lawyers said. Prosecutors need to show that a trader such as Sarao intended to artificially influence prices rather than trade legitimately, and they need unanimous support from a jury to win their case.To show intent, prosecutors will likely point to trading patterns to try to show Sarao never intended to fulfill his trades, or they may use documentary evidence such as emails if they have it, the lawyers said.Prosecutors' decision to charge Sarao indicates they think they can meet the higher burden in his case, said Jonathan Macey, a professor at Yale Law School. \"The most amazing thing is that it's a criminal charge,\" he said.The case marks the first time U.S. regulators have alleged that market manipulation played a role in the flash crash, in which the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 1,000 points before recovering somewhat toward the end of trading.The securities lawyers agreed in interviews that U.S. prosecutors appeared to have very detailed allegations about the sequence and types of orders Sarao put in, which may indicate they have a strong case.But the lawyers said that if Sarao pleads not guilty, he has options for his defense, beginning with his intent.\"That defense likely will be that, in the commodities market, he had a right to take naked short positions and that the government cannot prove criminal intent because, in certain markets, it is permissible to engage in naked short selling,\" said Jacob Frenkel, a former enforcement lawyer with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission now in private practice.Naked short selling occurs when an investor taking a short position sells a security without at first borrowing it or making sure that it can be borrowed.Duke University law professor James Cox said Sarao's defense \"may be technical, to try to put a more benign context on his order trail.\" But he added, \"That's going to be very unlikely.\"In another rare manipulation case, defense lawyers have attacked a provision of securities law. Lawyers for high-frequency commodities trader Michael Coscia of New Jersey sought to have his indictment from October thrown out on the basis that the charge of \"spoofing\" is too vague. But last week, a federal judge denied their motion, leaving the indictment in place. No trial date has been set. A lawyer for Coscia did not return a call for comment on Tuesday.Securities lawyers said Sarao's case may have wider significance by creating an example of someone. Many high-frequency traders cancel many of their trades before they are filled, they said.\"This complaint uses frequent cancellation of orders as evidence of intent to deceive the market and drive prices down. That may cause some anxiety among high frequency traders who cancel the majority of their trades,\" said Columbia Law School professor John Coffee.As for how many trades can be canceled before drawing the attention of authorities, Coffee said: \"The answer's always going to be gray.\" (Reporting by David Ingram, additional reporting by Jonathan Stempel.

Search business revenue was up 19.5 percent year-on-year to $531.7 million. Yahoo said its recent deal to become the default search engine on Mozilla's popular Firefox browser boosted search volume.

Shares of Mylan traded below the offer price of $82 in cash and stock, evidence of investor skepticism that Teva can win over the company, which has set up a defense that includes a poison pill.Analysts agreed that Teva would need to sweeten its bid to the $90-per-share range. S&amp;P Capital IQ analyst Jeffrey Loo said a viable offer would be $92, about 22 times Mylan's 2015 expected earnings.\"If they raise their bid, they will have more Mylan shareholders pressuring management to come to the table,\" Loo said. He suggested Teva would need to increase the cash component of the offer, which is now at 50 percent.\n        \n        \n\n\nMylan has yet to respond publicly. The company is pursuing an unsolicited, $29 billion bid for Perrigo Co Plc, a major producer of over-the-counter medicines, in an apparent attempt to stave off interest from Teva. Perrigo has not yet responded to that offer, saying it would consult its board, but a source familiar with the matter said the company was set to reject Mylan's bid as soon as this week.Mylan Executive Chairman Robert Coury said last week that the company had studied the potential for a deal with Teva and concluded that such a combination \"is without sound industrial logic or cultural fit,\" and would attract antitrust scrutiny.Teva said its offer should be more attractive to Mylan shareholders than the proposed purchase of Perrigo, representing a 48 percent premium to the company's share price before speculation of a deal surfaced on March 10. Pressure has been growing on Teva for new revenue sources as multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone starts to face generic competition this year. Teva said the purchase would help it to expand its offering of harder-to-produce medical products, such as soft-gel caps, topical and inhalant technologies and injectables, and increase its portfolio of specialty pharmaceuticals.The acquisition would create an entity with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, add to earnings in the first year and eventually generate $2 billion in annual savings, Teva said. It expects that a transaction could close by the end of 2015 and pledged a quick response, including selling assets if necessary, to ease any regulatory concerns.Mylan shares were up 8.9 percent at $74.12 in afternoon Nasdaq trading, while Teva rose 2.0 percent to $64.55 on the New York Stock Exchange. Perrigo fell 2.2 percent to $193.79.HEALTHCARE DEAL FRENZYA Teva-Mylan deal would be the second-largest healthcare transaction in the last 12 months, following generic drugmaker Actavis Plc's $66 billion purchase of Botox maker Allergan. The wave of consolidation has also included AbbVie Inc's proposed purchase of Pharmacyclics and Valeant Pharmaceuticals' deal for Salix.Generic drugmakers are looking to get bigger and gain access to product lines with higher profit margins, while traditional pharmaceutical companies have tried to add novel treatments for cancer and rare diseases.         Teva Chief Executive Officer Erez Vigodman said the companies should meet to address Mylan's concerns. In a letter to Coury, he said a deal would create \"an organization with the scale and reach to excel in the current environment, which I know you appreciate.\"A turnaround specialist, Vigodman joined Teva last year, tasked with cutting costs and improving profits under pressure from rising competition. In February, he said the company was ready to return to making acquisitions. A Mylan purchase would be the largest deal in Israeli history.Mylan recently moved its headquarters from the United States to the Netherlands, where corporate taxes are lower and where it could take advantage of Dutch anti-takeover provisions that can dilute shares by granting a call option to a foundation set up for this purpose.   In early April, Mylan said it had entered into such a call option agreement.Sanford Bernstein analyst Aaron Gal said in a research note that Perrigo was likely to reject Mylan but might then start negotiating with the company. That would push Mylan to campaign to win shareholder support for its purchase.At the same time, Teva will start its own campaign to publicly convince Mylan shareholders of the merits of its offer. Mylan is likely to demand a higher price, shared management and maybe some employee job protection, he said.

But the U.S. dollar's recent surge to multiyear highs against major currencies, such as the euro and yen, has also become a challenge to their efforts to protect market share on home turf.Harley's U.S. market share slipped nearly five percentage points in the first quarter to 51.3 percent as competitors offered discounts of up to $3,000 per bike and slashed suggested retail prices by up to 25 percent.Honda Motor Co Ltd and Suzuki Motor Corp both currently offer $1,000 cash back on selected models. Suzuki has cut the suggested retail price on 13 models and Honda is offering low-interest financing.Harley says it will not compete on price to protect its brand, a declaration welcomed by industry analysts.\"They (Harley) are taking a reasonable long-term view of the market,\" said Michael Millman, founder of Millman Research Associates in New Jersey. \"They want to maintain their pricing and their image and will have to take some of the competitive knocks that go with that.\"AUTOS, HEAVY EQUIPMENT HITHarley-Davidson is not alone in feeling pricing pressures from the dollar. Many companies including Caterpillar Inc and U.S. automakers Ford Motor Co, General Motors Co and Chrysler also face tougher competition as result.Unlike Harley, Caterpillar benefits from the natural hedge of having much of its production overseas, said Longbow Research analyst Eli Lustgarten. The Peoria, Illinois-based construction equipment maker does face \"stiff face-to-face competition\" from Japanese rival Komatsu Ltd when bidding on projects, he said. Other market factors face Caterpillar besides the dollar. While the U.S. construction market is solid, Caterpillar's energy- and commodity-related businesses have \"gone off the cliff\" as oil and commodity prices have fallen, Lustgarten said.But U.S. automakers face a different challenge. Many \"foreign\" brand vehicles are now built in the United States of parts sourced from North American factories, said Barclays analyst Brian Johnson.Rather than competing on car price tags, automakers like Toyota Motor Corp  are instead likely to focus on adding more frills and gadgets to vehicles without raising prices.This could put pressure on suppliers like Delphi Automotive that produce added options like advanced driver assistance programs or infotainment, rather than GM, Ford or Chrysler directly, Johnson said.To ride out the currency turmoil, manufacturers such as Harley, with production mostly in the United States, will have to weigh tough choices between cutting prices to spur demand, or cutting production to avoid getting stuck with too much inventory.Jaime Katz, an analyst at Morningstar, said thanks to more flexible just-in-time manufacturing, Harley can quickly adjust production up or down. The company signaled it expects shipments to drop as much as 10 percent in the second quarter.If the dollar remains strong, she will be watching to see if the motorcycle maker cuts its shipment forecast when it next reports earnings in July, as it did on Tuesday.At some point, Harley could face a tough choice about what to do with its existing floor models if it cannot sell them later in the year, she added, noting that is some way off.The problem with discounts is that customers come to expect them, said S&amp;P Capital IQ equity analyst Efraim Levy.\"If you cut prices, people expect discounts hold out for a better deal,\" he said.Foreign motorcycle makers are also taking a gamble by cutting retail prices that could hurt them if the dollar weakens, Levy added.\"Reinstating prices is harder than raising prices again,\" he said. \"Then you run the risk of consumers getting sticker shock.\" (Reporting by Nick Carey, additional reporting by Ben Klayman; editing by G Crosse and Joseph White)", "newspaper": "Reuters", "id": 405, "pubdate": "Wed, 22 Apr 2015 02:49:44 +0530", "title": "At Harley and beyond, strong dollar offers competition discount edge"}, {"content": "\n\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministers will not set any deadline for Greece to come up with reforms to get more funding because such time limits lead to brinkmanship in negotiations, a senior euro zone official said on Tuesday.\nGreece, which is quickly running out of cash, pledged to its euro zone partners in February that by the end of April it would agree with creditors on a comprehensive list of reforms to get 7.2 billion euros remaining from its bailout.Euro zone officials had expected the list to be presented to euro zone finance ministers this Friday in Riga. This would allow for a faster disbursement of cash to Athens, helping the debt-laden country avoid default on loan repayments on May 12. But no package will be ready by then and it is also unlikely it will be ready by the end of the month. This is mainly because in the past weeks Greece has not been providing the creditors with the financial data they seek or saying clearly what reforms it plans.Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras will meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel at a European Union summit on migration on Thursday and the two are expected to discuss the funding crisis.Speaking in Vienna, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker urged Greece to step up efforts to strike a deal with its, warning that talks were not advanced enough to find a quick solution.A senior euro zone official involved in the talks said there had been some improvement in negotiations very recently, but not enough for a deal.\"There is a clear pick up in activity, there is a clear pick up in engagement, but we are a significant way away from a signal that a result is in sight,\" the official said.\n        \n        \"(But) the use of deadlines, which leads to certain brinkmanship and unnecessary excitement, will not be done again.\" CASH CRUNCHIn a sign of how extreme the financial constraints have become, Athens on Monday ordered state entities, ranging from municipalities to a fund meant for future generations, to park idle cash at the central bank.The official said such a step would help Greece's liquidity.\"With the decree that was passed yesterday the situation, within the limits that there are, is well manageable,\" he said.But reaching an agreement with creditors on a comprehensive package of reforms by the end of April was unlikely, despite one more week left after the Riga meeting.\"If you want to present some kind of comprehensive agreement to the authorities and the institutions, analyze it, send it to the Euro Working Group to work on it, which then filters out the political questions for the Eurogroup to debate, it will be extremely difficult to keep the deadline of April 30,\" he said.The problem was not ideological differences between Tsipras's left-wing government and the euro zone, but rather lack of information.\"I do not see any ideological fights,\" the official said. \"We need to know exactly what out of the whole program are the 70 percent which Greece has said was acceptable, or which are the 30 percent that are not, and once we have a firm picture of that, we can start discussing that,\" the official said.\"We are not there yet, and if there ever were to be such a 'fight', the preconditions for it have not been created,\" he said.The bailout and the financing it offers expires on June 30.

Penalties are likely to exceed $1.5 billion, the amount UBS Group AG (UBSG.VX) paid in 2012, Reuters reported previously.If negotiators complete the settlement as planned, it could help remove uncertainty that has burdened Deutsche Bank shares for years, but would not wipe the slate clean.The world's second-largest foreign exchange trader still faces potential claims or settlements over past issues including alleged attempts at foreign exchange benchmark manipulation and alleged violations of U.S. sanctions on Iran.At the end of 2014, Deutsche Bank had set aside 3.2 billion euros ($3.4 billion) in litigation reserves, outlined another 1.9 billion in potential risks and indicated it faced an additional 4.8 billion in mortgage repurchase claims. \u201cThe full extent of DB\u2019s litigation costs is unknown,\u201d wrote ratings agency Fitch in a recent note. \u201cIt is likely that costs at DB will remain a drag on its future results despite the existing coverage (reserves).\u201dThe expected costs of the Libor settlement have increased over the past half-year, with the bank originally expecting to pay around 1 billion euros to settle Libor claims with U.S. and UK authorities.After several delays, German financial watchdog Bafin will likely sum up its own investigation into Deutsche's role in the rate rigging scandal as early as May. The regulator, which has worked independently of U.S. and UK authorities, has found no evidence that key managers of the bank knew about alleged manipulation.Deutsche Bank has already settled with European antitrust regulators over Libor and its euro equivalent Euribor, agreeing to pay 725 million euros.Fines and settlements have been a burden on management at Deutsche Bank, leading to a boardroom reshuffle in October in which auditing head Christian Sewing moved to the board as chief of legal and incident management, charged ed with clearing the decks.The bank plans to decide on a major restructuring as early as this month.

However, analysts have been encouraged by FICC numbers that were flat year on year. FICC accounts for about half investment banks' revenues.Total revenue at the U.S. quintet and Credit Suisse from FICC, equities and investment banking fees was $34.98 billion, up a modest 5.9 percent from the same period last year, according to Christopher Wheeler, U.S. banks analyst at Atlantic Equities.\"FICC is showing some signs of life but that is because rates are back, commodities are back and there's been more volatility surrounding events like the Swiss franc cap. This is positive given the dull FICC markets in recent years,\" Wheeler said.The first quarter has been notable for the Swiss National Bank's removal of its cap on the Swiss franc, the European Central Bank's trillion-euro bond-buying quantitative easing (QE) program, speculation over U.S. interest rates and a rollercoaster ride for oil prices.VOLATILITY BOOSTThis has created the type of price fluctuation and market volatility that traders thrive on, offsetting the seemingly perennial downward pressures on trading revenue from tighter regulation, dwindling liquidity and increased automation in financial market trading.FICC revenue at the top 10 global banks has risen year on year only once since 2009 and is down about 50 percent overall since then, data from industry analytics firm Coalition shows. In that light, this year's first-quarter stagnation has been greeted by some as a welcome development.\"With higher volatility and continued support from euro zone QE, we believe that the investment banking earnings cycle is at a turning point,\" Citi analysts wrote in a note on Tuesday. The big winners have been Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, with revenue up 15 percent and 10 percent respectively year on year, while Citi registered a fall of 11 percent, Atlantic Equities analyst Wheeler said.Credit Suisse, the first big European bank to report first-quarter results on Tuesday, posted FICC revenue up 8 percent year on year. Barclays, HSBC and UBS will all report by May 6.Revenue from other banking activities also showed signs of life. Equities income was up 23 percent while advisory and capital markets revenue gained 11 percent, a Reuters analysis of results at the big five U.S. banks shows.Global M&amp;A deals this year had topped $1 trillion by April 8, the earliest the threshold has been reached since 2007, according to financial data provider Dealogic.\"Low rates have translated into a surge in mergers and an increase in currency trading, both big money makers for investment banks,\" BlackRock's Global Chief Investment Strategist Russ Koesterich said.\"We see the favorable environment for this sector continuing and would remain overweight in large, global financial firms.\" (Editing by David Goodman)", "newspaper": "Reuters", "id": 409, "pubdate": "Tue, 21 Apr 2015 21:33:03 +0530", "title": "Banks' first-quarter trading revenue prompts cautious optimism"}, {"content": "\n\n(Reuters) - New York's banking regulator will not settle with Barclays Plc (BARC.L) over foreign exchange trading in coming weeks unless the deal excludes a probe of the possible rigging of rates through computer programs, the agency's superintendent said on Tuesday.\n\"There are two options: You can do a settlement in May with a carveout, or you can do a settlement later without a carveout,\" Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of New York's Department of Financial Services, said after a Dow Jones event in midtown Manhattan.Barclays is among a handful of banks expected to come to terms in the coming weeks with the U.S. Department of Justice and other authorities over manipulation of foreign exchange rates. Barclays is the only bank in the group that is licensed and regulated by New York state. The other banks likely to settle are JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N), Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS.L) and UBS Group AG (UBSG.VX). Lawsky said on Tuesday it would probably take several months for the agency to complete its probe of whether Barclays  has used computerized programs to manipulate foreign exchange rates.Investigators have been trying to determine whether such programs allow banks to take advantage of clients when pricing currency transactions.  In November, regulators fined HSBC Holdings Plc HSBA.L., JPMorgan, Citigroup, RBS, UBS and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N)  a combined $4.3 billion for failing to stop traders from trying to rig the foreign exchange market.Barclays did not join that settlement because of issues with the New York regulator, people familiar with the matter told Reuters at the time.It is unclear how Lawsky's decision will affect any upcoming deals involving Barclays.\"That's going to be up to Barclays and up to the other regulators,\" Lawsky said. Barclays spokeswoman Kerrie Cohen declined to comment, as did Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr.Authorities probing the foreign exchange market have generally focused on suspected collusion between certain employees over the rates, as shown in transcripts of traders in online chat rooms that led to the November settlements. New York installed monitors at Barclays and Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) to assist with probes of foreign exchange algorithms. Other banks under scrutiny by the state over their forex systems include Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN.VX), BNP Paribas SA (BNPP.PA) and Societe Generale (SOGN.PA), sources have told Reuters.

But the tax department and the government seem to believe that this tax can be levied for previous years.

The present government is largely going by the precedent set in case of Castleton Investments, where the Authority for Advance Ruling (AAR) gave a verdict, that Castleton is liable to pay MAT when it transferred shares from a Mauritius entity to a Singapore entity. Castleton Investments is owned by the Wellcome Limited of UK that held shares of Glaxo India which it transferred to its Singapore entity as part of the post-merger restructuring of Glaxo and Burroughs Wellcome.\u00a0&#13;\n&#13;\n\tFrom a policy point of view, there was a grey area on whether FIIs are liable to pay MAT. Thus, AAR levied it and the government of the day did not clarify. The matter is pending in the Supreme Court now.\u00a0&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n\t4) Do all FIIs have to pay this tax?&#13;\n&#13;\n\tThe tax authorities have currently sent notices to 90 foreign portfolio investors registered as 'companies' in India. FPIs registered as trusts or partnerships will not come under the ambit of MAT for now.&#13;\n&#13;\n\t5) Which FIIs will be exempt from MAT?&#13;\n&#13;\n\tCurrently, FIIs \u00a0which have come to India through Singpore, Mauritius and Netherlands are exempt under the DTAA (double tax avoidance agreements). However, FIIs and their legal advisors are not sure how long these FIIs will be exempt.&#13;\n&#13;\n\t6) So, what next?&#13;\n&#13;\n\tAn appeal against the applicability of MAT on FIIs is pending in the Supreme Court, but the timeline of the case coming up for hearing and final settlement is not clear.

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley reminds the market of UPA\u2019s finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, who introduced the now-dreaded retrospective tax. Despite repeated mentions and explanations by Jaitley and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the markets are not convinced that this government is sincere about not taxing foreign firms on a retrospective basis.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tIndia is not a tax haven and taxes that were payable by foreign investors should be paid and others should be challenged, Jaitley said earlier this month. Markets did not take kindly to these words, correcting sharply despite a global rally.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tJust when the market was stabilising on Tuesday, finance ministry officials were quoted as saying that the government will not relent to pressure from FIIs for withdrawing taxes worth Rs 40,000 crore that is is due from earlier years.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tClearly, the government is in a fighting mood. Unfortunately, neither the finance minister nor his ministry seems to grasp the repercussion of such a move on the markets. Broking firms are already jittery on the government stance and have organised conference calls between tax experts and their clients. The general perception is that taxes on FIIs pertaining to prior years will hurt sentiments.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tThe fear is that FIIs might be asked to pay taxes on capital gains from 2009 onwards. Foreign funds would have already either redistributed those profits or re-invested them. The markets fear that the only way they can pay tax is by selling Indian shares.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tConfrontation between the government and FIIs depends on an ongoing case in Supreme Court where Castleton Investments, a Mauritius based company has challenged the ruling of Authority of Advance Rulings (AAR) in India. Government officials are largely going by the precedent of the case of Castleton Investments, wherein the Authority for Advance Ruling (AAR) gave a verdict in August 2012, that Castleton is liable to pay MAT when it transferred shares from a Mauritius entity to a Singapore entity. Castleton Investments is owned by the Wellcome Limited of UK that held shares of Glaxo India which it transferred to its Singapore entity as part of the post-merger restructuring of Glaxo and Burroughs Wellcome. \u00a0\u00a0&#13;\n&#13;\n\tBroking firms feel that the move by tax authority will dampen spirits. CLSA has come out with a note titled Tax Menace, saying that if the Supreme Court upholds the AAR ruling then the case of the income tax authorities will become very strong. CLSA organised a Q&amp;A with tax experts from Deloitte who said that investment entities incorporated as \u2018companies\u2019 will only be impacted. Other structures such as trusts and partnerships should be safe.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tThe taxpayers could potentially go to the Disputes Resolution Panel (DRP) against these orders, says the note. DRP gives its verdict in nine months and tax liability, if any, will materialise only then. The option of going to the Supreme Court, ultimately, always exists. This means that the uncertainty would be long drawn and will be an overhang on the market.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tEdelweiss interacted with Anish Thacker, Partner, Ernst &amp; Young (E&amp;Y) and concluded that the probability of levying MAT on capital gains by FIIs is very low and even lower for tax payers registered in countries where the double taxation avoidance agreement (DTAA) provides tax benefits. Thacker said that there is a consensus view within the tax consulting community that MAT should not be applicable on foreign companies, including FIIs and FPIs. Since these entities are not required to prepare books of accounts in India, levy of MAT on book profits does not arise.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tThere are several cases where decisions have been in favour of the tax payer and MAT has not been levied as in the case of Timken, Praxair Pacific and Krung Thai Bank. However, Edelweiss notes that the Castleton Investment case outcome will be applicable.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tFinance Minister Arun Jaitley did his bit in making life uncomfortable for the FIIs. In the recent budget he made it clear that \u2018going forward\u2019 MAT will not apply to foreign companies. This has been interpreted by tax authorities as MAT will be applicable for past years. Thankfully the statute of limitations in India is seven years implying that tax authorities cannot issue notices to cases prior to 2008-09.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tTax experts feel that it will take three years for Supreme Court to announce its judgment in the Castleton Investments case, till such time markets will be jittery.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tIn any case FIIs have a case to be annoyed by Indian laws. First they are invited to invest in the country by the government promising them no taxation if they enter through countries with which India has signed tax treaties and then they are issued tax notices on grounds of technicalities and change of rules. The spirit of the law has not been followed.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tThese are not confidence building measures by the Indian government. Jaitley has clearly failed in allaying fears of FIIs and every time he and his ministry demands tax from FIIs market feels nothing has changed with a change in government.

The bank wanted to run a background check on some Indian promoters looking to raise capital abroad. As the offer was underwritten, the bankers wanted to ensure everything about the company and its promoters was above board.Instances of investment bankers seeking reputational and forensic due diligence on promoters are many.

This could lead to large financial liability for the banker if an issue goes awry.\u201cIt (the practice) has picked up through the past 12 months, as the economy has begun to look better.

While the former want to ensure their investments are in safe hands, the latter, at times, seek to know whether their money has been siphoned off by promoters. Investment bankers face similar risk exposure and seek to run qualitative and quantitative checks on a person or a company with whom they conduct business.\u201cIn the case of some IPOs (initial public offerings), the underwriter taking the exposure might appoint a firm to conduct reputational due diligence. This includes background checks covering the company, and its directors and key management personnel. Such due diligence could also include searching for unknown related parties, looking into significant transactions with such related parties, checking whether a key related party is in financial distress or has large loans backed by corporate guarantees and whether there have been regulatory issues associated with the parties involved,\u201d says Dhruv Phophalia, managing director, Alvarez &amp; Marsal. He heads the firm\u2019s global forensic and dispute services practice in India.\u201cIndia\u2019s positive business environment has drawn the interest of global investment banks.

This was a 170 basis point reduction compared to a cash holding of 4.2 per cent at the end of February, the data show.The decline in cash levels indicates fund managers were nibbling amid stocks entering a correction (fall) phase.

Post that, there were opportunities across the sector and we chose to buy. Investor inflows in equity schemes continue to remain robust,\u201d said a chief investment officer (CIO) with a leading asset management company (AMC).An analysis of cash holdings of top fund houses also indicate most of the leading entities saw their cash levels dip between January and March. The country\u2019s biggest fund house, HDFC MF, which manages equity assets worth Rs 55,000 crore, saw its cash holding drop from 1.57 per cent (Rs 898 crore) in January to a mere 0.59 per cent (Rs 327 crore) in March.&#13;\n\t\t&#13;\n\tSimilarly, Reliance MF, with Rs 44,400 crore of equity assets, reduced cash levels to 1.32 per cent (Rs 585 crore) from 3.28 per cent (Rs 1,444 crore) for the period.

Given the fixed costs, the move, which might result in subscribers opting for the service only for a part of the month, will impact Dish TV\u2019s leverage and margins. Given the offer, seems to be targeted at the semi-urban and rural markets, this could impact Dish TV, as it has large subscriber base in these markets. Phase III and Phase IV compulsory digitisation is in the semi-urban markets and are scheduled to be implemented by December 2015 and December 2016.The Dish TV management has, however, said the move by its rival won\u2019t affect it. R C Venkateish, chief executive officer, says from a new customer acquisition perspective, there is zero impact as a customer who will pay Rs 8 once in a while is not going to pay Rs 2,000 upfront. \u201cAs far as new customers are concerned, those on Dish platform won\u2019t be impacted. Tata Sky is downgrading its own customers, which is why this is a self-goal.\u201dTata Sky is looking at tapping the rural base further with this low denomination recharge, which will enable the DTH subscriber the flexibility to pay for days of use rather than a monthly subscription where the service may not be availed on a daily basis.Dish TV, on the other hand, has been customising its content for regional audiences with its brand Zing. The Tata Sky move, according to analysts, could also be a move to counter the success of Zing. \u201cHowever, the move is unlikely to have a major impact on Dish TV\u2019s business or financials,\u201d said an analyst with a domestic brokerage.While the Tata Sky move could impact other players, analysts say the key worry would be if the recharge war is to escalate to one on the set top box. This is the largest upfront cost (Rs 1,700-2,000) that customers make when they subscribe to one of the DTH services.&#13;\n\t&#13;\nIn the near term, the Street will also look to the operational performance in the March quarter, where Dish TV is expected to post strong net subscriber additions at 4-5 lakh. Average revenue per user is expected to decline 1.2 per cent sequentially or stay flat given fewer days in the quarter. Despite the lower ARPU, operating profit is expected to be maintained given flattish content costs.

Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) margins are expected to move up from 22.7 per cent in FY14 to about 24.9 in FY15.Importantly, cash flows from operations are improving, which should provide funding for future growth and customer acquisition.

The latter's debt was Rs 2,776 crore as on January 31.The company is in the business of toll operations and operates road infrastructure projects. These include long-term OMT (operate-maintain-transfer) and BOT (build-operate-transfer) projects in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Andhra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal.Among the notable large projects are the Mumbai Entry Points one, where it collects toll at five entry points into the city (toll plazas at Airoli, Vashi, Dahisar, Eastern Express Highway, Mulund and LBS Marg, Mulund). Such projects are long-term and have upfront payment to be made.For instance, Mumbai Entry Points is a 16-year project, starting November 2010, for which MEP has given upfront payment of Rs 2,100 crore.\u00a0 While such projects are big enough and likely to have a positive bearing in the longer run, the high upfront payment has led to raising of substantial debt.In this backdrop, high interest costs in the initial years and high amortisation has hit MEP\u2019s profits. Analysts believe this particular project is so structured as to generate losses for the first few years, despite regular traffic growth. Another reason for losses widening in FY14 was the Chennai Bypass OMT.The company suffered loss of revenue from this on account of certain force majeure issues arising from non-compliance with certain provisions of the project contract by National Highways Authority of India. It is likely to get compensation of up to Rs 150 crore.With stress on the balance sheet, the company\u2019s finance costs have increased from Rs 5.3 crore in FY10 to Rs 143 crore in FY14, on a consolidated basis. Coupled with regular increase in depreciation and amortisation (Rs 126 crore in FY14 against Rs 46 lakh in FY10) and operating and maintenance expenses growing 2.5 times to Rs 801 crore in FY14, MEP reported loss before tax of Rs 143.2 crore in FY14 versus profit before tax at Rs 49 lakh in FY10.&#13;\n\t&#13;\nOverall losses have increased from Rs 1.3 crore in FY10 to Rs 119.6 crore in FY14.

TCS registered lower than expected sales and profits, at least in part due to the rupee's strength. The rupee has strengthened appreciably against most currencies.The fourth quarter (Q4) results of TCS provide pointers to likely results from other exporters. TCS registered lower than expected sales and profits, at least in part due to the rupee's strength. The rupee has strengthened appreciably against most currencies.Between January 1 and March 31, the rupee was up by 11.9 per cent, 6.26 per cent, 1.5 per cent and 1.2 per cent versus the euro, pound, yen, and dollar respectively. The trend of lower profits may have been exaggerated for TCS, since it has larger euro-denominated revenue than most information technology (IT) majors and the rupee strengthened a lot versus the euro.But the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI's) 36-currency basket suggests the rupee is over-valued by something like 20 per cent on average. This is unusual. In general, RBI has a history of intervening to prevent over-valuation from exceeding five per cent or so on that basket. In fact, RBI has been buying forex in massive quantities, boosting reserves to record levels to keep the rupee from appreciating even more.The rupee strength has had an overall negative effect on merchandise trade. The second half of the last fiscal was especially poor, with exports declining in every month except November. Overall, India's goods exports declined by 1.2 per cent (in dollar terms) across 2014-15 (imports also declined by 0.4 per cent, mainly due to lower crude prices).The TCS results indicates a negative impact on IT services as well. We could extrapolate that it may have had a negative impact on pharma exports as well. So, there could be a sequence where the majority of IT and pharma companies, and also other exporters, deliver lower profits and sales in Q4. In turn, that could lead to a sell off on such counters.The chances are that the rupee will not move down until and unless one or all the following things happen. RBI takes strong measures to push the rupee down. Alternatively, forex inflows reverse. Or, crude prices climb sharply.There are several reasons for rupee strength. India has been the beneficiary of strong forex inflows in debt, in equity and in foreign direct investment over the past year. Also, several central banks have deliberately weakened their respective currencies.The Bank of Japan has instituted a massive Quantitative Expansion(QE) programme and maintained zero interest rates. The European Central Bank has more recently, launched a massive QE. The UK has also maintained interest rates at near-zero. The Chinese central bank has cut rates twice and also eased money supply considerably. Against that barrage of competitive currency measures, RBI has just made two minimal 25-basis point rate cuts. So, in comparative terms, the rupee has got stronger.RBI is the only institution, which has enough information to balance off the pros and cons of where the currency should be. There is a cost to boosting reserves. Forex assets held in safe government securities offer negligible yields at this time. A strong currency retards export competitiveness. But a weak currency makes imports expensive, which means that a weak rupee could stoke inflation if crude and gas prices climb. The rupee fell by 55 paisa against the dollar on Monday. There was heavy FII selling of rupee assets and nervous dollar buying from importers since crude prices have jumped 20 per cent in the last 10 sessions. The rupee may have a significant downside from here on, if those trends - FII selling and higher crude prices continue to move in tandem. There could be a case for being prepared to short IT and pharma stocks as results come in. There could also be a case for being prepared for a reversal in the rupee across several currency pairs.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tThe author is a technical and equity analyst", "newspaper": "Business Standard", "id": 447, "pubdate": "Tue, 21 Apr 2015 22:44:00 +0530", "title": "Case building up for a weaker rupee"}, {"content": "&#13;\n         &#13;\n    &#13;\nRetrospective taxation concerns, muted earnings and weakening rupee continued to drive markets further into consolidation with the benchmark Sensex falling over 210 points to 27,676.04 and NSE Nifty slipping below the crucial 8,400-mark on Tuesday.&#13;\nRetrospective taxation concerns, muted earnings and weakening rupee continued to drive markets further into consolidation with the benchmark Sensex falling over 210 points to 27,676.04 and NSE Nifty slipping below the crucial 8,400-mark on Tuesday.Sun Pharma added to the rout by tumbling 8.70 per cent on both the Sensex and Nifty, after Japan's Daiichi Sankyo announced selling of its holding in the Indian drugmaker.

Also, the continuous fall in sugar prices have destabilised the balance sheets of sugar mills, resulting in banks taking a cautious approach.\u201cCane arrears have reached the highest ever of Rs20,000 crore. Mills were not able to arrange working capital to pay to farmers. But, arrears are going to precipitate next season. With around 10 million tonnes of carryover stocks, prices are unlikely to improve substantially. Thus, 30 per cent of mills would not be able to start crushing next season. Raising working capital would be a major problem which means, only financially viable companies would be able to continue crushing,\u201d said Narendra Murkumbi, managing director, Shree Renuka Sugars.During the ongoing season, 530 sugar mills started crushing of cane of which 240 declared early closure of crushing activities by April 15, as they were not able to procure cane while the remaining 290 continued their operations with low capacity.The problem is more acute in north India, especially in Uttar Pradesh (UP).\u201cObviously, at least 25 per cent sugar mills will face problems for raising working capital next season, if the current trend continues, because of falling sugar prices resulting into steep fall in valuation of their stocks,\u201d said a senior official with a UP-based sugar mill.&#13;\n\t&#13;\nWith sugar prices falling, the value of collaterals in the form of sugar pledged by mills to banks has also fallen. And hence, \u201ca number of banks are not extending working capital loan to sugar mills. Banks seem to be worried over the recovery. In the current season also, a lot of mills either did not get working capital loan at all or got much less than last year. Many units got a massive cut in valuation of their inventory from banks due to sustained fall in sugar prices,\u201d said Abinash Verma, director-general, Indian Sugar Mills Association (Isma).According to industry sources, many large, medium and small mills were affected due to falling sugar prices and unfavourable fuel policy. While the surplus sugar availability in the country did not allow its price to move up, continuous upward revision in cane prices squeezed mills\u2019 crush margins. Consequently, sugar mills\u2019 profitability fell sharply over the past six-seven quarters.

With 7.5 million tonnes of carryover stocks from last year, India will have a total availability of 34.5 million tonnes this year against the estimated consumption of 23.5 million tonnes. Interestingly, the government allowed Rs4,000 a tonne of subsidy on raw sugar exports. However, Indian exporters failed to contract export deal due to falling sugar prices in global markets.\u201cSugar mills have pledged their produce to banks. Based on the current market rates, banks have concluded a valuation of Rs2,200 a quintal of sugar. With 15 per cent margins kept with banks and Rs500 a quintal for bank recovery, mills can raise the balance amount from banks. Therefore, the loan amount works out to less than the fair and remunerative price (FRP) fixed by the Centre,\u201d said Sanjiv Babar, managing director, Maharashtra State Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories (Sugar Federation).In the beginning of the current season, October 2014, the Centre allowed a cane FRP at Rs220 a quintal, a marginal rise of Rs10 from Rs210 a quintal. Uttar Pradesh continued with a Rs285 a quintal of State Advised Price of cane.\u201cDefinitely, there will be a problem next season for sugar mills. Farmers will protest for residual cane arrears, if any, which hit all-time high this season at Rs2,985 crore as of now in Maharashtra,\u201d said Babar.Isma has estimated total peak arrears of Rs19,300 crore by April 15.Meanwhile, sugar prices have fallen by 24 per cent to Rs2,200-2,300 a quintal against the cost of production of Rs3,400 a quintal. Considering the average income of Rs500-600 a quintal from by-products, mills will continue to incur losses of at least by Rs600 a quintal. Given the current circumstances, no bank will be interested in extending loans to a sector with a loss-making balance sheet, said Babar.", "newspaper": "Business Standard", "id": 450, "pubdate": "Tue, 21 Apr 2015 22:34:00 +0530", "title": "A fourth of sugar mills to remain un-operational next season"}, {"content": "&#13;\n         &#13;\n    &#13;\nThe Solvent Extractors Association of India (SEA)\u2019s fourth round report on the castor seed survey for 2014-15 predicts minor reduction in production, compared with the third round report published in February.&#13;\nThe Solvent Extractors Association of India (SEA)\u2019s fourth round report on the castor seed survey for 2014-15 predicts minor reduction in production, compared with the third round report published in February.According to the latest report released on Tuesday, total castor seed output in the country would be 1.27 million tonnes (mt) in 2014-15. The report in February had estimated the output to be about 1.29 mt, while at the same time, government estimates had put the output at 1.38 mt.The survey was undertaken by Nielsen in the first half of April in Gujarat and Rajasthan. It will conduct the fifth and final round of survey in the first week of May.\u201cProduction is estimated to be slightly down in the revised report but overall, we will record higher output compared to the previous year. The market is already at a bottom level and market fundamentals will determine further downfall,\" said B V Mehta, executive director, SEA, the premier association of vegetable oil industry and trade in India.According to the new report, castor seed output in Gujarat has been estimated at 1.01 mt, highest in India, followed by Rajasthan with 167,000 tonnes and Andhra Pradesh with 75,000 tonnes. Other states would add 24,000 tonnes to India\u2019s production.Last year in December, the price of castor seed touched a high of Rs1,100 per 20 kg on the back of lower output estimates. But, following huge supply of new crop and decline in demand, the price has gone down by about 33 per cent and is currently ruling in the range of Rs700-725 per 20 kg.The price of castor seed depends on demand for castor oil in the international market. This year, the demand has been low. Accoding to SEA data, castor oil export stood at 400,084 tonnes between April 2014 and February 2015 as against 436,482 tonnes during the same period last year. Shipments declined by 36,398 tonnes from India.An Ahmedabad-based castor oil exporter and trader said, \u201cCastor oil demand from China and Europe is weak this year and there is currently no expectation for any rise in demand.

It is the biggest loss suffered by a UK retailer and one of the largest in the country's corporate history. Around \u00a34.7bn of the losses were the result of the fall in property value of its UK stores, 43 of which it said would close earlier this month.The decline in the value of its property portfolio comes as a direct result of falling footfall in many of its out of town superstores. Tesco's chief executive Dave Lewis admitted it had been \"a very difficult year for Tesco\".  Tumultuous yearHe added: \"The results we have published today reflect a deterioration in the market and, more significantly, an erosion of our competitiveness over recent years. \"We have faced into this reality, sought to draw a line under the past and begun to rebuild, and already we are beginning to see early encouraging signs from what we've done so far.\" He added that he  expected conditions in the coming financial year to remain challenging.But investors reacted positively to the results.

'Another shocker'It has started a consultation with staff to replace the current defined benefit pension scheme with a cheaper defined contribution scheme. Marc Kimsey, senior trader at Accendo Markets, described the results as  \"another shocker\" from Tesco.

Wonga's new management team has been highly critical of the \"problems of the past\".Chairman Andy Haste, who arrived last summer, says that the company needs to repair its reputation and only lend to those who can afford to repay loans.Scandals, including letters from fake legal firms when chasing debts, and advancing a host of unsuitable loans, have caused such damage to the brand that a name change is not off the cards.But key data that explain the big shift into the red include a 36% fall in lending volumes and a fall in customer numbers from a million in 2013 to 575,000 last year.This restriction in lending came as the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), squeezed the life out of some lenders in a bid to stop vulnerable borrowers being pulled into spiralling debt.The regulator's main weapon is a cap on the cost of payday loans of 0.8% of the amount borrowed per day, which came into force in January.In addition, there is a \u00a315 cap on default charges. No borrower has to pay back more than twice the amount they initially borrowed, lenders can no longer roll over a loan more than twice, nor can they attempt to reclaim payment from a borrower's account more than twice.It is not only Wonga that has been affected, according to trade body the Consumer Financial Association (CFA). It claims that stricter regulation has changed the face of the High Street.Its analysis suggests there has been a 58% fall in the number of stores offering short-term loans since 2013. Even more striking is its estimate that the volume of payday loan approvals has shrunk by 75% from its 2013 peak.What does this mean for the future?The attention of the regulator has resulted in some big names slashing their workforce or exiting the market altogether.The Cheque Centre, which had 451 branches, announced that it would stop selling loans that needed to be paid back in one lump sum. Meanwhile, The Money Shop, a payday lender owned by US firm Dollar Financial, axed a host of stores.The FCA says that there have been about 400 short-term lenders with permission to operate in the UK, but nobody is in any doubt that the total will plummet.Now all payday lenders need to pass strict FCA assessments in order to get permission to carry on.The deadline for applications for those licences was the end of February. The FCA has yet to say how many applications were made and processing those applications will take many months. So the scale of any exodus is not yet clear.Richard Griffiths, of the CFA, says many of the smallest payday lenders will not have bothered putting in an application and so will stop lending. He estimates that only around 30 lenders are actively making loans subject to the new cap on the cost.Still, that is many more than the three or four that the regulator itself believed would eventually get through the tough assessment process.Wonga has put in a \"good application\", according to its chairman, who pointed to the strengthening of its lending criteria and introduction of the new price cap.Asked if it is still possible to run a profitable payday loan business under the new industry regime, he says it is, but his company is suffering from \"legacy issues\".\"Could you start a payday business today within the cap and be profitable? Yes,\" he says.But he predicts that Wonga will no longer rely solely on \"one product and one price\", although he did not spell out what the new products might be.Mr Griffiths argues that many lenders have already moved away from the one month, short-term, high-interest loan to tide borrowers over until the next payday. Instead, many now offer mini personal loans for six months or so.Where will all the borrowers go?Some payday lenders may have given the industry a \"tarnished image\" in the words of its own trade body, but there is no doubt that payday loans have been popular.In its results, Wonga makes an unusual estimate - claiming that its research suggests around 13 million people across the UK are \"cash and credit constrained\" and are under-served by mainstream financial services.These are people who may have defaulted on loans, overdrafts and credit cards in the past and so struggle to secure more credit from banks or building societies. So, if the payday lending industry starts turning them away or providers disappear entirely, where can these borrowers go?A recovering economy and rising wages might reduce demand and increase the supply of loans from traditional lenders. If not the regulator says many people will find a way to tighten their belts, or turn to family and friends for help.Some, it is feared, might turn to illegal loan sharks.Consumer groups and charities argue that loans are the cause, not the cure, of financial stress.\"More loans are not always the answer,\" says Mike O'Connor, chief executive of the StepChange debt charity.\"We must do more to help people on low incomes to save for a rainy day so that they are less likely to need to borrow in emergencies.\"\n    ", "newspaper": "BBC", "id": 473, "pubdate": "Wed, 22 Apr 2015 04:32:38 +0530", "title": "Will Wonga and other payday lenders survive?"}, {"content": "For decades supermarkets just got bigger and bigger.Selling bread and beans was all very well, but the real growth was to be found in tempting shoppers with other products.Swimsuits, barbecue kit, microwaves, Halloween costumes - the merchandise became more and more exotic. Going to the supermarket became an endurance event as trolleys became bigger, to hold flat screen televisions and computer printers.It was not uncommon to see shoppers trying to wrestle two trolleys through the checkout.It all seems slightly comical now, unless of course you are a supermarket boss.'Profound uncertainty'Shopping habits have changed, leaving supermarket chiefs wondering what do to with their cavernous stores.\"I've never seen such profound uncertainty; everything is up for grabs,\" says veteran retail industry expert Richard Hyman.For shoppers it means that supermarkets are likely to look very different in years to come. The biggest stores could become more like department stores and also house other services like gyms, nail bars and parcel collection points.But what's prompting this \"profound uncertainty\" and urgent need for change?'Super profits'From around 2005 supermarkets were chasing market share. So the big supermarket chains built more stores and in the case of Tesco, and to a lesser extent Sainsbury's, they built very big stores.There was plenty of money for investment back then as supermarkets were making \"super profits\" says James Watson, head of retail investment at Colliers International a leading commercial property consultants.But that strategy began to fall apart when the recession hit and, in a remarkably short period of time, shoppers changed their spending habits.The slow recovery in wages after the financial crisis made shoppers more cost conscious and some switched to discounters like Aldi and Lidl. Other customers started to shop online and top-up their shopping from the growing number of convenience stores.\n                        Shoppers have been moving away from the big 'trolley shop'\n                    \n                Size mattersThose trends have proved a challenge for the supermarkets - particularly those that invested in giant stores.\"No food supermarket should ever be bigger that 45,000 square feet,\" says Bruno Monteyne, senior analyst of food retail at investment firm Bernstein. That figure may not mean a lot to you, but it's the size of small football pitch and about the size of the average supermarket.Mr Monteyne estimates that 20% of Tesco's store space is \"heavily under utilised\". For Sainsbury's he says the figure is 10%.He thinks Asda is somewhere between the two, but as it's owned by US giant Walmart, it is harder to make an estimate.Morrisons has a smaller proportion of the huge stores, so it is less troubled by under used space, but it has been hurt by competition from discounters.\n                        Sainsbury's is experimenting with Argos stores in its supermarkets\n                    \n                Dead spaceSupermarkets have begun to acknowledge that they have a space problem.In some cases the value of their property portfolios has been written down - an accounting measure to reflect the reduced value of their stores. In March Morrisons took a \u00a31.3bn charge corresponding to the falling value of its properties.The retailers have also been coming up with new ways to use space that is currently unprofitable.Back in November Sainsbury's said that only 6% of its total store space was under utilised. It said that half of that space would be used to sell its clothing lines and other \"general merchandise\" and they were \"looking at opportunities for the remaining 3%\".One such opportunity was detailed in January when Argos announced plans to open ten pilot stores in Sainsbury's.Analysts speculate that Tesco might do a deal with Sports Direct under which the sports retailer would open concessions within Tesco supermarkets.Parts of the biggest stores could even be converted into mini-malls, with space for other smaller retail outlets like dry-cleaners, nail bars or gyms.Another innovation might be to open click-and-collect desks, where customers could pick up parcels ordered from other online retailers.\"Supermarkets will become the post office of the future, as sort of a hub for local communities,\" speculates Mr Monteyne.\n                        Nail bars may be among the retailers that take space in big supermarkets\n                    \n                Looming price warRichard Hyman is not optimistic about that strategy.\"Generally these joint ventures, they don't work,\" he says.\"There have been loads of these and generally and they usually come out of weakness and not out of strength.\"He is also doubtful about the merits of supermarkets expanding their non-food businesses. \"The grocery business is just not very good at selling non-foods,\" he says.For Mr Hyman the big supermarkets have got to get better at the core things they do instead.And, in his opinion, that is likely to result in a further round of price cuts.Once Tesco has \"cleared the decks\" he thinks the company needs to be \"much, much, much more aggressive in price\" particularly compared to the other big three retailers.\"I think the price war is down the road - it's going to happen,\" he says. Good news if you're still in the habit of packing your trolley to the brim.\n    ", "newspaper": "BBC", "id": 474, "pubdate": "Wed, 22 Apr 2015 04:32:22 +0530", "title": "Supermarkets: Everything 'up for grabs'"}, {"content": "\n                        The famous German orchestra is now based at the school in a housing estate\n                    \n                Tenever is a high-rise housing estate with a reputation for poverty and crime, located at the end of a tram line in the northern German city of Bremen.Eight years ago, one of Europe's best-known orchestras moved their rehearsal rooms to a secondary school on this housing estate and pupils from Tenever found themselves sharing their corridors and lunch tables with professional musicians.Since then the school's results have improved, its drop-out rates have fallen to less than 1% and the atmosphere in the wider neighbourhood has been \"transformed\", according to Joachim Barloschky, a local official who oversaw a programme of renovation and regeneration in the area.Next month, the pupils who started at the school at the same time as the orchestra will sit their final exams. There is optimism because the number of pupils leaving school with the lowest qualifications has plummeted and the number staying on to take the Abitur exam at the end of secondary school has risen sharply.This might sound like the plot of a feelgood film. But for the pupils of Bremen East comprehensive school (known in German as GSO), the musicians of the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen have become part of their daily lives. Rehearsing successThe unusual arrangement happened by accident. The orchestra was looking for a new rehearsal space at the same time that the school was being renovated. \n                        The arrival of the orchestra has changed the image of the Tenever district of the German city\n                    \n                The city authorities made the connection, the builders made sure the rooms had excellent acoustics, and the orchestra moved in shortly afterwards.At first, the arrangement was not popular on either side. \"We had thought we would move to an iconic building in the centre of the city,\" says Stephan Schrader, a cellist in the orchestra. \"The teachers thought the kids already did not have enough time for learning without having to skip another maths or English lesson to talk to musicians,\" says Annette Rueggeberg, co-head teacher.More stories from the BBC's Knowledge economy series looking at education from a global perspective and how to get in touchThe school and the orchestra devised a series of projects to bring musicians and students together. Musicians would visit classes to talk to pupils and once a year the musicians would help pupils and residents of Tenever to write and perform an opera. Tuning inBut what makes the partnership unique is the sheer volume of interactions between musicians and pupils. Whenever they are not playing, the musicians are based in the school. \n                        Pupils and musicians work alongside each other at the school\n                    \n                They sit with pupils over lunch and talk to them about their lives. Pupils are allowed to watch the orchestra rehearse, sitting between the musicians rather than in front of them as an audience.Ms Rueggeberg says: \"Normally you only see an orchestra dressed up for a concert, but the kids mostly see them running around in jeans and find them very approachable. It has broken down the barriers.\"The improving results and the presence of the orchestra have changed people's opinions.\"For a very poor area where so many students come to us with German as a second language, this is really quite something,\" says Ms Rueggeberg. \"The whole atmosphere of the school has improved and we no longer have such problems with fighting or aggression or graffiti.\"Students from all over Bremen now want to join the school.\"In the past you could not imagine pupils travelling from well-off parts of Bremen to a very poor area but now we have to turn them away because we do not have enough space. We have become the most popular school in the city.\"Local prideThe orchestra has helped to remove the stigma attached to the neighbourhood surrounding the school, says the former district manager Joachim Barloschky. \n                        The orchestra in Bremen was looking for new rehearsal rooms as the school was being renovated\n                    \n                \"People used to say about Tenever, 'Don't go there, they are poor, they are from different countries, many of them are criminals,'\" says Mr Barloschky. \"Now we are known as the district that has the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen and everyone has more self-confidence.\"\"After one community opera, a child ran up to me and asked: 'Did you see the people coming all the way from Hamburg to see us in a very big Maserati?' They are no longer ashamed of where they come from but proud of their school and their district.\"Is there something special about music that has led to these improvements? Research has suggested links between music education and improved reading comprehension, language development, IQ scores and creative skills. \"While other activities can be beneficial, music seems to have a wider range of benefits,\" says Professor Susan Hallam at UCL Institute of Education.'Why we play music'The pupils also benefit from encountering people from the unfamiliar background of classical music. \n                        Pupils learn from the musicians sharing their school\n                    \n                Max Haimendorf, head of secondary at King Solomon Academy in central London, says his school has improved since it became compulsory for every pupil to play in an orchestra. \"By performing at places like the Barbican and working with people from a classical instrument background, the knock-on conversations, opportunities and experiences our pupils get has really broadened their perspectives,\" he says.But the orchestra in Bremen plays down the role of music.There are many music education schemes that teach pupils for a week or invite them to a special concert, says Lea Fink, who runs an education programme for the orchestra.\"But the value of our project lies in the long and persistent groundwork and the feeling of trust that has developed between the children and the musicians.\"\n                        Pupils have a chance to perform with musicians from the orchestra based in their school\n                    \n                \"We do not try to be music teachers, but we let them see that we are normal people,\" says Mr Schrader. \"I ask students about their families and tell them about mine.\"When they have a problem, I know about it. I am not the one who will find the solution, but I am one more adult person they have contact with.\"So should other top orchestras, cultural organisations or even sports teams consider moving into a school? Mr Schrader thinks so. \"The experience has actually improved us as an orchestra,\" he says. \"When the children sit between us at rehearsals, our concentration is better. We can actually see their eyes grow wide with excitement when we play certain chords or play quickly. \"It reminds us of the reason we make music, which is sometimes easy to forget.\"\n    ", "newspaper": "BBC", "id": 475, "pubdate": "Wed, 22 Apr 2015 14:57:17 +0530", "title": "How an orchestra moved in with a school"}, {"content": "\n                        President Rousseff is under pressure to quit\n                    \n                In 2008, Petrobras and its main stakeholder - the government of Brazil - hit the jackpot.The state oil firm's technicians discovered one of the world's largest oil reserves deep beneath the seabed - under miles of layers of salt.And then two years later, it struck gold again, finding yet another giant oil reserve.Optimism was running high. The firm went to the markets and raised over $70bn - the world's largest share issue ever.Brazil's economy was at cruising speed too, finally taking off after years of meagre growth.But the good times did not last long - for neither the company nor the country. A massive corruption scandal last year eroded much of Petrobras's market value.Brazil's economy too has been on a downward spiral - with high inflation, slow growth and low confidence.So how did it all go so wrong, so fast?'Petrossauro'Petrobras's oil bonanza and Brazil's emerging star status are fairly recent phenomena.Just a few decades ago, prospects were dire for both.In the early 1990s, Brazil was a young democracy in deep economic trouble.Annualised inflation was running close to 5,000%. Decades of protectionism meant there was little competition in most sectors and many national firms had become inefficient.Petrobras was seen as part of that landscape by many who wanted to privatise it. One critic used to refer to it as \"Petrossauro\" - a large, outdated structure that moved slowly and was doomed to extinction in the modern world.\n                        Protestors demonstrate against President Rousseff and her role in the alleged corruption scandal\n                    \n                \n                        Demonstrations were held in several cities\n                    \n                Brazil's fortunes started to change in the mid-1990s - both internally and externally.Through reforms, successive governments were able to defeat hyperinflation, open up Brazil's economy to the world and redistribute growth, lifting millions out of poverty.A decade of global economic boom favoured Brazil's champion exports - commodities like coffee, soya, beef and oil.Brazil's oil sector was opened to foreign companies, but local laws made sure Petrobras kept its role at the top of every major project. A decade of high international oil prices helped give a great boost to the firm's investment plans.By 2010 - after all oil discoveries - it felt like Brazil and Petrobras had finally \"arrived\" at the top.But then things took a turn for the worse.CorruptionOne problem was Petrobras's desperate need for cash.Brazil's treasure trove is buried deep below the pre-salt layer and can only be extracted with expensive methods.President Dilma Rousseff was adamant that Petrobras should play a major role in all fields, although it did not have the resources to do it alone. \n                        Petrobras still has its supporters\n                    \n                So the company sought to attract partners and raise money abroad by selling many of its assets.Just as it was taking on its biggest financial challenge ever, Petrobras was hit by a recurrent obstacle in Brazil's history: corruption.An investigation by Brazil's Federal Police revealed that the state oil giant was being used illegally as a cash cow for most parties in the government coalition.Its top executives are all politically appointed by the government. They allegedly handed out Petrobras contracts in exchange for party donations and bribes.A string of high-profile arrests were made - from top Brazilian CEOs to the treasurer of Rousseff's ruling party. More than 40 key politicians are under investigation, including the presidents of both houses of Congress.Confidence in the company eroded almost overnight - both in the markets and in the streets.Its own CEO was sacked for not being able to handle the crisis.Tens of thousands of Brazilians took to the streets against President Rousseff - who chaired the board of Petrobras for much of the period when the alleged bribes happened.Difficult timesIt could not have come at a worse time for Brazil's economy.It is stuck in low gear, now that the commodity boom seems to be over, and its goods are no longer in high demand.Until last year, the government had been trying to navigate through the crisis by raising spending and pumping money into the economy.Why is it expensive to extract oil from the pre-salt layer?The pre-salt layer is made up of rock that was laid down millions of years ago before a layer of salt - which can be thousands of metres thick - accumulated above it.Some of the oil formed in the pre-salt layer has not leaked up into the layers above.This oil is often of good quality, but is buried so deep that access to it is difficult.According to Petrobras, there may be 50 billion barrels of oil in the pre-salt layer found in the Brazilian continental shelf.Petrobras itself was used as an instrument of that policy. The state oil firm controls the internal price of fuel, and for three years it helped Brazilians get cheaper petrol. But the subsidies hurt the company at a time when it needed all the cash it could get for its pre-salt project.Now the government has done a u-turn in its policy, going radically from stimulus to austerity.In the past, Petrobras has helped the government get through downturns, as its investments alone represent 2% of Brazilian Gross National Product. But now it is making matters even worse.One study by FGV Business School suggests the fall of Petrobras investment could knock about $30bn off the Brazilian economy, with more than a million jobs lost, mostly in construction.Push for transparencyPetrobras and Brazil have been trying to react to the crisis with a push for transparency.On Wednesday, it is expected to reveal in an independently audited balance sheet just how much money was stolen.Later this month, it will replace some politicians in its board of directors with respected market figures, like the president of mining giant Vale, Murilo Ferreira.The energy minister has even signalled that the government might ease access to pre-salt projects for foreign firms, reducing the burden on Petrobras.Some say Brazil has learned some lessons.\"If you concentrate everything - all wealth - in a single company controlled by the state then it is very easy for the political system to go there and try to grab resources,\", says Sergio Lazzarini, an academic at Insper Business School.\"You can avoid this with more competition, more transparency, more regulation.\"Recession and impatienceBrazil and Petrobras still have a difficult path to follow. \n                        Petrobras has been a huge success story\n                    \n                Most economists predict Brazil will be in recession this year. And the corruption scandal is far from over, as no-one has been tried yet.President Rousseff insists Brazil and Petrobras will come be stronger after this crisis, as historic corruption is finally being investigated after decades of omission.Brazilians hope she is right, but the mood in the country is bleak.After decades of low expectations, Brazilians had come to think in recent years that the nation was finally emerging into the world stage as a global power, only to see it again stuck with corruption and low growth.While many still recognise the country is much better off than in the years of hyperinflation and \"Petrossauro\", optimism has now been largely replaced by scepticism and impatience.Brazil's treasure trove, it seems, will take a while longer to dig out.\n    ", "newspaper": "BBC", "id": 476, "pubdate": "Wed, 22 Apr 2015 06:10:31 +0530", "title": "Petrobras\u2019s oil bonanza: Blessing or curse?"}, {"content": "", "newspaper": "Forbes", "id": 477, "pubdate": "Wed, 22 Apr 2015 14:30:00 +0530", "title": "World's Biggest Oil Companies - 2015"}, {"content": "\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nLast year Eldar Saetre took over as CEO of Statoil Statoil, the Norwegian oil giant. As Statoil\u2019s former CFO, and a 35-year veteran of the company, Saetre, 59, has slipped comfortably into the role vacated by Helge Lund, who left to become CEO of BG Group BG Group, which is being acquired by Royal Dutch Shell Royal Dutch Shell. \nThough based in Oslo, Saetre is in the U.S. this week for the first time since becoming CEO. In addition to giving a speech today at the IHS IHS-Ceraweek conference in Houston, he sat down with Forbes on Monday for a half-hour conversation about his thoughts and objectives at this historic time for the industry. In short, he says, he is focusing Statoil on cutting costs, maintaining flexibility and taxing\u00a0carbon. \nCutting costs seems a no-brainer. According to Statoil subsea development costs are up 250% in a decade, and they think increased standardization in the subsea could in time help preserve profitability at lower commodity prices. They\u2019d like to match the improvements gleaned in shale plays like the Eagle Ford. When Statoil entered the Eagle Ford in 2010 it took them 52 days to drill a well. Now that\u2019s down to 15 days. \nBut that latter goal \u2014 cutting carbon and becoming the world\u2019s most carbon-efficient oil company \u2014 is a surprising aspiration to hear from any oil company CEO. And it\u2019s a real point of differentiation between Statoil and some of its American oil giant peers. You simply won\u2019t hear an American oil CEO say, as Saetre told me, that oil companies need to support United Nations\u2019 efforts to impose a global cost on carbon. \n\n Eldar Saetre, speaking Tuesday at IHS-Ceraweek in Houston. (Photographer: Aaron M. Sprecher/Bloomberg via Getty Images)\n \nJust last week Statoil and the Norwegian government (which owns a controlling stake in the company) joined with a handful of other oil giants to sign a landmark World Bank pact to stop flaring natural gas by 2030. France\u2019s Total Total, Italy\u2019s Eni Eni and even Shell also signed the pact.\u00a0No U.S. companies joined them. \nNaturally, an oil company that promotes carbon controls is a jumble of contradictions. If carbon is so terrible then why doesn\u2019t the Norwegian government simply order Statoil to leave all its oil and gas in the ground?

But the Congress-led opposition is determinedly blockading it and last week Congress\u2019 Rahul Gandhi, heir apparent to the party\u2019s president Sonia Gandhi (his mother), told a farmers\u2019 rally that the bill was \u201canti-farmer\u201d. \nThe amendments proposed in the new bill will ease rules to acquire land so the Modi government can unleash a series of projects aimed at reshaping crumbling infrastructure in cities, setting up industrial corridors, building smart cities, expressways and super-fast bullet trains \u2013 all of which are land-intensive projects. \u201cIndia is open for business,\u201d Modi declared last month during much-publicized visits to Germany, France and Canada where he pitched to foreign investors. \nBut land, a scarce resource that whips up extreme emotions in densely-populated India, appears to be a big obstacle. Any easing of rules to acquire rural land is especially seen as crushing the rights of the poor and small land holders. On the other hand, investors are repelled by the red tape, high costs and long timelines involved in acquiring land under current rules. \nThe land acquisition bill, on which rides many a foreign investment proposal and numerous corporate expansion plans, can go through the lower house of parliament, the Lok Sabha. But it cannot become law unless it also receives assent in the upper house, the Rajya Sabha, where Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party does not have the requisite majority to push it through. \nThe new bill proposes amendments to smoothen land acquisition for key uses such as rural infrastructure, defense projects, industrial corridors, urban infrastructure and affordable housing. On it rest several of prime minister Modi\u2019s pet programs, including the ambitious \u201cMake in India\u201d which emphasizes manufacturing within the country rather than importing. \nThe bill\u2019s last avatar enacted by the Congress Party-led government in 2013 had stringent clauses on land grabbing and forced relocation of land owners, which was seen by industry bodies as still too complicated and restrictive. \nModi government\u2019s bold attempt to revise the bill and ease some of the requirements, including doing away with a social impact assessment of land acquisition and not requiring 80% land owners\u2019 assent to acquisition for key uses, is bringing on accusations that the government is pandering solely to business interests. Businesses funded the Modi victory and he is now paying back by helping filch farmers\u2019 land, Rahul Gandhi accused at the farmers\u2019 rally. Modi has maintained that his is a pro-poor, pro-farmer government and that the new land acquisition bill is a \u2018rational framework\u2019. \nOne thing, however, is abundantly clear. Unless the standoff over the land acquisition is sorted, Modi cannot go through with his ambitious economic reforms agenda for India. \n Indian prime minister Narendra Modi seen with German Chancellor Angela Merkel during a recent visit (Image: narendramodi.in)[/caption]\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t", "newspaper": "Forbes", "id": 479, "pubdate": "Wed, 22 Apr 2015 13:41:00 +0530", "title": "Modi's Economic Reforms Agenda In India Hits Biggest Roadblock - Land"}, {"content": "\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nIn response to an invitation this past weekend from director Zack Snyder, fans filled IMAX theaters across the country Monday night to view the first official trailer for the filmmaker\u2019s upcoming superhero team-up/battle movie Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Warner Bros. released a version of the trailer online earlier than planned over the weekend, after someone illicitly recorded it overseas in a movie theater (in typical low quality with a cell phone) and it was subsequently spread online by some fan sites and a few mainstream media outlets. \nHowever, the IMAX fan event offered a slightly different version of the trailer, plus a few words from Snyder himself via a pre-recorded video in which he points out a few elements that aren\u2019t noticeable when you watch the trailer on a computer or mobile device. Attendees were also treated to free posters \u2014 two, one of Batman and one of Superman \u2014 on their way out of the theater. And of course, there\u2019s the bonus of experiencing it with a big group of other fans who stand around talking before and after the screening. Oh, and attendees all got free tickets to a special early screening of Batman v Superman before it\u2019s released in theaters. \n[embedded content] \nI arrived at the AMC Century City IMAX in Los Angeles, just outside of Beverly Hills, in the early afternoon to make sure I secured my spot at the front of the line. Fans began trickling in a few at a time, and then suddenly about an hour before the event\u2019s 7pm start-time, the line got big and stretched across the balcony, down the stairs, and through the lobby. Even film producers Adrian Askarieh (the Hitman franchise) and F.J. DeSanto (The Spirit and Shazam!) were on hand for the festivities. One of the great things about these types of events is the comradery that springs up among people just by virtue of standing next to one another in line for a few hours. We\u2019re all there as fans, and we\u2019re all excited to see whatever it is we\u2019re waiting on, and it heightens the enjoyment of the entire experience. Which is one of the many reasons that it really does matter\u00a0 \u2014 to fans, anyway \u2014 whether or not studios offer such events. \n \nI already knew shortly after I arrived that they\u2019d be handing out tickets to a free advance screening of Batman v Superman to everybody who attended the IMAX events. But most fans waiting in line hadn\u2019t heard yet, so when the announcement was made about half or more of those in attendance were shocked and thrilled to find out. \nSnyder and company deserve big bonus points for this particular decision, not only as a service to the fans who signed up and showed up, but also from a marketing perspective \u2014 those who did grab tickets to these IMAX trailer screenings and showed up to wait in line for hours are likely among the hardcore fanbase, and so most are probably predisposed to like the film and promote it to their friends and family. Getting them into theaters to see it for free creates even stronger positive feelings, and so the likely overall buzz from these advance screenings is going to be favorable and add to the hype in the final week leading up to release. \nThe trailer itself was mostly the same as what we already saw online, but with a couple of big differences. First of all, the IMAX screening contained footage that won\u2019t be released online, and is exclusive to the trailer event screening. And second, seeing it in IMAX demonstrated the difference between the regular footage and the sequences actually shot with IMAX cameras. \n \nThe different footage was just a few seconds, but it was electrifying. At the end of the trailer, we see Superman and Batman crouch down, and then hurl themselves toward one another. The scene ends with the two titans crashing into one another, fists raised and teeth gritted in fury. If the lead-in scenes of an armored Batman and red-eyed Superman already had you salivating over the prospects of their epic confrontation, I assure you the extra footage of them rushing headlong into combat and colliding is even better. \nAfter that second helping of the trailer, fans raced out to grab some nice and sturdy posters from Batman v Superman, made specially for the IMAX event \u2014 you\u2019ve likely already seen them online, but they look even better in large size suitable for framing. \n \nSnyder\u2019s personal video to fans lets us know there\u2019s the added bit of footage exclusive to the fan event, and then the director tells us to watch the trailer one more time, paying attention to the quality of the final shots that were filmed in IMAX. And he\u2019s not kidding, as anyone familiar with movie footage shot in IMAX already knows. The whole trailer is epic and larger than life, but those final shots are just spectacular. Watching the Dark Knight and the Man of Steel do battle in true IMAX style is going to be mind-blowing. \nIn the aftermath of the IMAX trailer screenings, Snyder also tweeted out a thanks to all the fans who attended, and released a great new shot of the bat-suit from the film. It\u2019s a real thing of beauty, too (and FYI, apparently Batman will be able to turn his head, despite the cowl appearing to have a solid neck, so fan rejoice!)\u2026 \n \nNow that we\u2019ve seen how the IMAX event turned out, it\u2019s time for me to give you my thoughts on the trailer. So read on, and find out why this trailer isn\u2019t just great, but why it demonstrates something important about the comic film genre and the need for precisely this sort of starkly different approach to superhero cinema!\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tPage 1 / 3\n\n\t\t\t\tContinue \n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t", "newspaper": "Forbes", "id": 480, "pubdate": "Wed, 22 Apr 2015 09:49:06 +0530", "title": "'Batman V Superman' IMAX Report - Why DC Is Different From Marvel"}, {"content": "\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nSelling to the modern day buyer requires that you enter the world of the modern day buyer.

Guangdong Yueke, formerly owned by state-run Yueke Technology Financial Group, works with more than 1,000 theatres and provides connecting software systems to more than 30 online movie-ticketing platforms including Alipay, Tencent Holdings Tencent Holdings, and group-discount site Meituan. \nYueke is one of the six\u00a0companies approved by Chinese regulators to provide online-ticketing systems. Last year it earned 11.3 million yuan ($1.8 million)\u00a0in profit on revenue of 51.8 million yuan ($8.4 million). \nState-owned Guangdong Technology Venture Investment Corporation has the right to repurchase 20% to 30% of Yueke within nine months after the completion of new corporate records registration. \nShares of Alibaba Pictures, which were halted on April 20, rose 14.9% when they resumed trading Wednesday. \nAlibaba Group has been expanding its entertainment offerings, as the company seeks\u00a0 to develop new businesses outside of e-commerce. The group on April 8 proposed to inject its online movie-ticketing business and its movie production crowdfunding businesses into the Alibaba Pictures Unit. \nThe purchase of Yueke will enable Alibaba Pictures to work with more movie theaters and connect them with hundreds of millions of users on its parent company\u2019s e-commerce platforms, according to the filing. \nIt will also increase the value of Alibaba Pictures, which was created when Alibaba Group acquired a 60% stake in Chinese movie studio ChinaVision Media Group and changed its name. In August, Alibaba Group found accounting problems at the unit. Revenue of Alibaba Pictures fell by more than 60% last year and it reported a loss of 417 million yuan ($67.2 million).\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t", "newspaper": "Forbes", "id": 482, "pubdate": "Wed, 22 Apr 2015 07:45:00 +0530", "title": "Alibaba Pictures Acquires Cinema-Ticketing Software Provider For $134 Million"}, {"content": "", "newspaper": "Forbes", "id": 483, "pubdate": "Wed, 22 Apr 2015 07:33:00 +0530", "title": "4 Game-Changing Technologies For The Deaf And Hard Of Hearing"}, {"content": "\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nDespite perpetual complaints about never having enough time in the day to do crucial work, many executives waste precious hours doing jobs that an executive assistant (EA) could do better, and for a fraction of the cost. Leaders who don\u2019t delegate such tasks visibly show everyone around them they aren\u2019t focused on leading. That erodes morale rapidly, especially when a company is in crisis. It also slows down executive career advancements. In contrast, the most effective executives use EAs wisely. That lets them devote every precious minute to leadership, team-building, and making important decisions that no one else can make. \nBut being smart about delegating responsibilities to an executive assistant is about much more than \u2018getting more done.\u2019 It\u2019s about partnering and building trust with an EA to elevate both your power and the power of your executive assistant. Cultivating mutual respect and a shared understanding of roles in this relationship is a top priority for C-suite executives. \nExecutives must realize that EAs are managers, not helpers. They make decisions and take initiative based on an understanding of high-level objectives. EAs are masters at unraveling complexities, guarding access, juggling competing demands for your time and anticipating your needs. When given the necessary tools and authority to do their job well, EAs can free up your time and extend your reach so you can focus on leading the company. \nMany executives don\u2019t understand that there are differences between executive assistants and secretaries. Some CEOs hire secretaries with misplaced expectations that they\u2019ll be able to deliver at an executive level, while others bring on highly qualified EAs, only to treat them as secretaries. Some pairings start off well, until executives fail to protect their EAs from being dragged into projects that are not core to their role. All of these scenarios cause frustration and upset, diminishing the EA\u2019s job satisfaction, leading to turnover and loss of continuity, or causing executives to become disenchanted by the whole idea of turning over responsibilities. \nConsider one CEO who directed his HR group to recruit a top-flight EA as the company grew to $100 million in revenues. The CEO knew he needed to focus more of his attention on their rapid growth, but he wasn\u2019t willing to give up booking his own travel and handling his own calendar. He figured it was easier to do these tasks for himself, rather than invest time in explaining his preferences to someone else. On the occasion that he did allow his EA to take over, she got things wrong because she didn\u2019t know his preferences. This then confirmed the CEO\u2019s thinking that it was \u201cbetter to do it himself.\u201d His failure to share adequate information with the EA created an atmosphere of mistrust between them. Not surprisingly, the EA left for a more satisfying job elsewhere, and the CEO had to direct his HR group to start a new round of hiring. \nTo bolster your effectiveness with an EA at your side, it is essential to acknowledge the uniqueness of this relationship and how building a healthy bond of trust and loyalty will determine your results. A set of practices that I call \u201cThe Four P\u2019s\u201d are useful reminders to be integrated into daily routines, never abandoned or disregarded\u2014especially when the pressure is on. \nThe Four P\u2019s are: (1) Partnership; (2) Priority; (3) Power; and (4) Panorama. \n(1) Partnership\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tPage 1 / 4\n\n\t\t\t\tContinue \n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t", "newspaper": "Forbes", "id": 484, "pubdate": "Wed, 22 Apr 2015 07:16:00 +0530", "title": "How The Most Effective Executives Avoid Getting Mired In The Small Stuff"}, {"content": "\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nA common saying is you can tell a bull market has run its course when your taxi driver starts recommending which stocks to buy. In China, everybody seems to be an expert today. \nWhile shares in Shanghai and Shenzhen have doubled in value over the past year, economic fundamentals are painting a distinctively gloomy picture for the world\u2019s second largest economy. China\u2019s GDP outlook hasn\u2019t looked this bad in 25 years, while concerns over a\u00a0real estate bubble, overcapacity and deflation plague\u00a0the wider economy. \nAnkur Patel, chief investment officer at R-Squared Macro, an investment firm based in the U.S., told me through e-mail that the speculative fervor in China has become worse over time. \n\u201cThis move into Chinese equities has become overstretched, especially with the PBoC pumping even more liquidity into the system to support growth. The rally in Chinese stocks has encouraged imprudent speculation, similar to that in the Chinese real estate markets, and may eventually collapse,\u201d he said. \n\n Customers checking stock prices at a China Construction Bank Corp. branch in Hong Kong. (Credit: Lam Yik Fei/Bloomberg)\n \nIf you plan to enter the Chinese market or add to your portfolio, here are some facts you should take into consideration first: \n\u2022 More than 10 million new stock accounts have opened so far this year, more than the total number for all of 2012 and 2013 combined, according to data from China Securities Depository and Clearing. \n\u2022 Many of these new players appear to be inexperienced retail investors, who are likely following the advice of friends or state-controlled media. \u201cI\u2019m just dabbling,\u201d 32-year-old Liu Wei told the WSJ. \u201cIf all your friends are buying stocks and talking about it, and you don\u2019t buy, then you have nothing to talk to them about.\u201d \n\u2022 About two-thirds of new equity investors left school before the age of 15, according to data from the China Household Finance Survey carried in a recent Bloomberg Bloomberg report. About a third left at age 12 or younger. \n\u2022 Six percent of new equity investors are illiterate, Deutsche Bank Deutsche Bank said in a note\u00a0about the \u201cChinese share frenzy.\u201d \n\u2022 New investors also have relatively low levels of asset ownership. Household wealth is about half the level of existing investors. \n\u2022 Median earnings multiples for Chinese technology stocks are twice U.S. peer valuations at their dot.com peak, Deutsche Bank said. More worrying perhaps, the note\u00a0added, is a health-goods-from-deer-antlers producer on 70 times, the seamless underwear manufacturer on 90 times or those school uniform and ketchup makers on 330 times. \n\u2022 At the Shenzhen exchange, famous for its many tech firms, half of stocks with analyst estimates have a forward PE above 50, writes James Mackintosh, a Financial Times blogger who called the market \u201cinsanely expensive.\u201d In the past year, almost half of all shares in Shenzhen have doubled in price or better. \n\u2022 Likewise, over a third of stocks in Shanghai with analyst estimates have a forward PE above 50. In the past year, four in 10 stocks have doubled in price or better. \n\u2022 The Chinese are the world\u2019s most\u00a0optimistic investors, according to a\u00a0Legg Mason Legg Mason and Citibank\u00a0survey. About 60% of them plan\u00a0to increase their equities this year. \nOutside the stock exchange in Shenzhen, a gigantic statue of a thunderous bull stands to symbolize the power of one of the world\u2019s best-performing stock market this year. At the same time, more government stimulus is expected this year that ultimately could\u00a0further boost market sentiment. \nHowever, it\u2019s a matter of debate whether the roaring bull is a sign of fundamental strength, or speculation frenzy fueled by enthusiastic mom-and-pop savers\u00a0and high-school dropouts.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t", "newspaper": "Forbes", "id": 485, "pubdate": "Wed, 22 Apr 2015 06:54:00 +0530", "title": "Crazy Facts About China's Stock Market That Will Make You Think Twice Before Investing"}, {"content": "", "newspaper": "Forbes", "id": 486, "pubdate": "Wed, 22 Apr 2015 06:42:00 +0530", "title": "What 'Daredevil' Season 2 Means for Marvel's 'Defenders' Plan on Netflix"}, {"content": "\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nI\u2019m spending this week with two colleagues and 60 smart, focused, energetic women leaders. \u00a0This is one of the two or three weeks each year we\u00a0conduct WICT\u2019s Rising Leaders Program, an intensive management and leadership skills \u201cbootcamp\u201d for high-potential mid-level women in the cable industry. \nEach time we conduct the program I\u2019m impressed by the quality of the attendees, and this time is no exception. \u00a0As the session opened yesterday\u00a0morning,we focused on how challenging it can be to learn new skills, especially in the semi-public setting of a group workshop. They all seemed up for the challenge. \u00a0Being a novice in public can be embarrassing, awkward and frustrating. Because once we get to be adults, we pride ourselves on being good at things. We really like feeling competent \u2013 even expert.\u00a0We don\u2019t much like having to go back to being bad at things. \nBut that\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re learning something new: you\u2019re bad at it. \nAnd given the speed at which everything is moving these days, we no longer have the luxury of trying new things in private. (With the exception of online games\u2026which may go a long way toward explaining the popularity of Angry Birds and Candy Crush \u2013 you can be terrible at them without anyone else having to know.) \u00a0Every day at most people\u2019s jobs, something changes: new products, new customers, new business models, new competitors, new processes and new technologies. \u00a0You have to understand\u00a0and learn these things right out there where everyone can see you. Yikes. \nSo, what\u2019s a person\u00a0to do? \nOne of the most important things: manage your self-talk\u00a0so that you\u2019re not making it harder for yourself than it needs to be.\u00a0I\u2019ve talked often about self-talk (our internal monologue) in this column; here\u2019s a post about it, in case you\u2019re new to the conversation. That silent monologue, that commentary that runs pretty continuously inside our heads, can be quite benign or actively destructive. \nUnfortunately, most people\u2019s self-talk when confronted with learning new skills tends to be on the unhelpful, destructive side of that continuum.\u00a0When trying to learn\u00a0new capabilities, we say things to ourselves like,\u00a0I\u2019m such a loser \u2013 I can\u2019t ever do anything right, or I going to look like a complete idiot \u2013 people will make fun of me behind my back.\u00a0This kind of self-talk is unhelpful because in berating us for our\u00a0our initial lack of skill and teling\u00a0us that everyone will judge us for not already being good, it just makes us more nervous, impatient, frustrated and embarrassed. \u00a0And when we\u2019re struggling with those demoralizing emotions, we\u2019re much less likely to be open\u00a0and focused enough to actually learn the thing. \nHowever, some people\u2019s mental monologue goes in an\u00a0opposite and equally unhelpful direction, and they think things like,\u00a0I got this \u2013 there\u2019s really nothing more to learn or I\u2019ll knock this out of the park first time. \u00a0This second kind of poor self-talk masquerades as self-confidence, which we think of as being positive. But self-confidence is not useful\u00a0if it\u2019s misplaced. \u00a0Because you\u2019re trying to learn something new, telling yourself that you already know it\u00a0simply closes you off from your actual need to get better \u2013 so you can\u2019t\u00a0learn.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tPage 1 / 2\n\n\t\t\t\tContinue \n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t", "newspaper": "Forbes", "id": 487, "pubdate": "Wed, 22 Apr 2015 06:32:00 +0530", "title": "The Secret To Getting Good At Things Quickly"}, {"content": "\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nYou might have thought scientists were done studying the MMR (measles mumps rubella) vaccine and autism. After all, numerous studies show no link between the two. But the anti-vaccine advocates frequently move the goalposts with their arguments, and one of those arguments is that the vaccine might \u201ctrigger\u201d a developmental disability only in certain children who are already susceptible to it. \nTherefore, researchers studied more than 95,000 children to find out if those at higher risk for developing autism were any more likely to develop the disability if they had received the MMR vaccine. \nThey weren\u2019t. \n\u201cThis study has been long awaited in the autism community \u2013 a retrospective look at families where the older sibling has ASD and the parent either does or does not vaccinate the younger child,\u201d said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and a pediatrician in the Division of Infectious Diseases\u00a0at The Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. \u201cThe benefit of this study is that the second child is at higher risk for autism, which makes for a more powerful study.\u2028\u201d \nIn fact, in the raw analysis of the study published in JAMA today, the likelihood of developing autism was actually lower for those at-risk children if they received the vaccine, though that finding was not statistically significant and no one would suggest that vaccination reduces autism risk. What vaccination reduces is disease, the kinds that can disable and kill children and the kind that is even more likely to cause serious complications in children with neurological conditions. \n\u201cIn addition to providing further evidence of vaccine safety, specifically MMR, this study dispels another myth: namely, that there\u2019s a subset of children who are somehow genetically or biologically predisposed to have an adverse reaction to MMR,\u201d said Dr. Mark Schleiss, a pediatric infectious disease physician at the University of Minnesota. \u201cThis is very useful because it provides parents with more reassurance about vaccinating children with neurodevelopmental issues \u2013 children who are particularly vulnerable to many vaccine-preventable diseases \u2013 and their siblings.\u201d \nAll of the children in the study had older siblings, and the 2% who had an older sibling with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) were considered at higher risk for developing the disability since autism has a strong genetic component. Overall, 1% of the children in the study eventually were diagnosed with ASD, including 6.9% of those with autistic older siblings and 0.9% of those with non-autistic siblings. \nThe vaccination rates for the first dose were 84% at 2 years old for the children with non-autistic siblings and 73% at 2 years old for children with autistic siblings. When the researchers compared vaccinated and unvaccinated children, both those who did and did not have an older autistic brother or sister, they found no increased risk for the disability among any of the children. \n\u201cThe findings were what one would expect,\u201d Offit said. \u201cTherefore, the choice not to vaccinate the younger child didn\u2019t decrease the risk of ASD. It only increased the risk of contracting measles, mumps or rubella.\u2028\u201d \nAlthough the study\u2019s findings might have been expected by those in the field and anyone who has followed the research, the research still cost money, and those funds, which came from the National Institutes of Health National Institutes of Health and a handful of major universities, might have gone to any number of other projects. \n\u201cUnfortunately, precious resources were invested in proving what we already knew \u2013 that MMR vaccine is safe and doesn\u2019t trigger autism \u2013 because of the sham and fraud promulgated by Wakefield,\u201d Schleiss said. Wakefield refers to Andrew Wakefield, the former gastroenterologist who lost his ability to practice medicine in the U.K. after he was found to have falsified a study with dozen children that he claimed (inaccurately) showed a link between the MMR and autism. \u201cWe must now focus those resources on legitimate scientific hypotheses about autism.\u201d \n\n Luke Tanner, 7, receives the combined Measles Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccination at an MMR drop-in clinic at Neath Port Talbot Hospital near Swansea in south Wales on April 20, 2013. Public health officials said on April 19 they were investigating the first suspected death from measles in Britain in five years, after an outbreak blamed on a campaign against vaccinations. (Photo: GEOFF CADDICK/AFP/Getty Images)\n \nResearchers also need to keep studying the measles disease and vaccine, he said, but not because of any possible link to autism. \u201cIt\u2019s now unequivocally proven that MMR vaccine is not associated with autism spectrum disorders,\u201d he said. But measles is still a threat across the world, killing hundreds of thousands of children, and the Disneyland outbreak last winter showed once again how highly contagious the disease is. \u201cThe research needs to focus on making measles vaccines easier to deliver, particularly in the developing world,\u201d he said. As the Mayo Clinic Mayo Clinic\u2019s Gregory Poland has said before, researchers can always work to make a better measles vaccine. Developing a better aerosol vaccine like the one described here yesterday might be an effective use of funds as well. \nIn an editorial accompanying the study, Dr. Bryan King, a psychiatrist and autism specialist at Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital, noted all the ways this research question has been studied. \u201cTaken together,\u201d he said, \u201csome dozen studies have now shown that the age of onset of ASD does not differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated children, the severity or course of ASD does not differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated children, and the now the risk of ASD recurrence in families does not differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated children.\u201d \nIn other words: the MMR vaccine and autism have nothing to do with one another for any child at any time in any place in any universe. The science is settled on this point. But that doesn\u2019t mean the fear will vanish from all parents\u2019 minds. \n\u201cUnfortunately, there will still be parents who have reservations about vaccines, but I don\u2019t blame parents \u2013\u00a0they are only trying to do the best they can for their children,\u201d Schleiss said. \u201cI am more concerned about the financial forces driving the anti-vaccine agenda. Behind every anti-vaccine web site there\u2019s someone looking to make a buck \u2013 by selling chelators, vitamins, creams, salves, natural foods, raw milk, nutritional supplements, secretin, electrostimulation, spinal adjustment, books, tapes and video. Fading Hollywood celebrities seek to revive their careers, and proponents of \u201calternative vaccine strategies\u201d seek celebrity status and write best-sellers. They are preying on vulnerable, resource-limited families who are desperately seeking answers. It\u2019s unconscionable, and no one\u2019s talking about it.\u201d \nAlso on Forbes: \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t", "newspaper": "Forbes", "id": 488, "pubdate": "Wed, 22 Apr 2015 06:28:47 +0530", "title": "MMR Vaccine and Autism: Yet Again, No Link Exists -- Even For Children At Risk For Autism"}, {"content": "", "newspaper": "Forbes", "id": 489, "pubdate": "Wed, 22 Apr 2015 04:51:00 +0530", "title": "NFL Schedule Release -- Yearlong Media Dominance"}, {"content": "\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n(Author\u2019s disclosure: \u00a0The author consults for\u00a0a fantasy sports provider that is in current litigation\u00a0against DraftKings, a company mentioned in this article). \nIn what could be extremely exciting news for the daily fantasy sports marketplace, Yahoo Yahoo announced today its planned entry into daily fantasy sports. \nYahoo\u2019s planned entry into the daily fantasy sports marketplace is good news for consumers in that it restores a third major player to the market. \u00a0Daily fantasy sports participants have not seen true competition for market share since July 2014 when DraftKings, the market\u2019s second largest player, acquired DraftStreet, the market\u2019s then No. 3 player. \nWith Yahoo\u2019s planned entry, Yahoo could\u00a0provide a real challenge to the market share of FanDuel and DraftKings, thus creating true price competition. \u00a0While Yahoo is far newer to the marketplace than the other two companies, it does already have a strong fantasy sports and search business that could easily drive traffic to its games. \nYahoo\u2019s jump into the marketplace also likely means that its chief rival in the full-season fantasy football market, CBS CBS Sports, is likely not far behind. \nUntil now, companies such as Yahoo and CBS Sports had stayed on the sidelines of the daily fantasy sports market due to the heightened legal risk. \u00a0But with this marketplace now operating in some form or another since 2007, one could make the reasonable conclusion that the risks seem manageable if carefully navigated. \n\n Yahoo! Sports has announced its intent to enter the daily fantasy sports marketplace this summer.\n \nOf course, there are still some very real marketplace risks to daily fantasy sports in some formats and in some states. \u00a0Thus, Yahoo would be wise to limit eligibility to its daily fantasy sports contests beyond just the five states in which it currently blocks its full season games. \u00a0Among others, Arkansas, North Dakota and Tennessee seem to be higher risk states of operating daily fantasy sports contests. \nYahoo may also wish to avoid offering contests \u2018played against the house\u2019, and to devise real ways of monitoring user age, location and addictive gambling behavior \u2014 all topics that merit careful scrutiny as states begin to review their own laws vis-a-vis daily fantasy sports.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tPage 1 / 2\n\n\t\t\t\tContinue \n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t", "newspaper": "Forbes", "id": 490, "pubdate": "Wed, 22 Apr 2015 04:17:00 +0530", "title": "Yahoo's Planned Entry Into Daily Fantasy Sports Market Is Good News; Helps To Stop Oligopoly Pricing"}, {"content": "\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nChina wants to write the rules for the world\u2019s largest and fast growing market \u2014 Asia.  \nAnd so are the US and its closest Asian ally, Japan. \nSo far, China maintains the lead with the launching and execution of initiatives that pave the way for the integration of local and national Asian markets. \nAsian and non-Asian countries\u2014some America\u2019s closest European allies\u2014have already taken notice; rushing and racing to join China-led initiatives like AIIB, in hopes of getting a piece of the mega-projects being financed by China. \nIn the meantime, the US and Japan, rather than joining China, are teaming up to write their own rules for the region, with a more ambitious plan\u00a0 \u2013 creation of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). \nThe trouble is, however, that the two countries cannot agree with each other on several principal trade issues arising from TPP. \nLast year, for instance, President Obama returned home from a Tokyo trip without a trade deal that advances the Trans-Pacific Partnership agenda. \nActually, the two sides seemed so far apart on a number of sticky issues in Tokyo (e.g., Japan\u2019s opening its rice, beef, and pork issues) that they had a hard time releasing a joint statement. \nThere is, for instance, opposition by some Japanese consumer groups over the quality of US agricultural products. \u201cThe TPP would press Japan into accepting unlabeled GMO foods into their markets,\u201d wrote a reader in a previous piece of ours here. \nThen there is opposition by Japanese farmers to agricultural products imports.

It\u2019s probably going to stand alongside Furious 7 and\u00a0Star Wars: The Force Awakens as one of the biggest movies of the year \u2013perhaps of all-time. A potential critical consensus similar to mine may theoretically cost Disney $3.72 over opening weekend, and I wish the marketing hadn\u2019t given so much of the little pleasures away, but little of that will matter.\u00a0The blockbuster sequel to the third-highest-grossing film of all time cost $250 million to make; it may make that back before it even opens in America. \nIt premieres in France on the 22nd and the U.K. on the 23rd, but it won\u2019t open until May 1st in America. The fans are excited, the film is looking at an opening weekend of over/under $215 million, and now it\u2019s just a matter of how big of an impact it makes the second time out. My review is much too long so I\u2019m going to leave it at that. Even if this film \u201cunderperforms\u201d (whatever that would be under these circumstances), everybody is already jazzed for Captain America: Civil War. \nThe only real negative if this film doesn\u2019t connect with audiences as much as the first one is a potential lessening of excitement for\u00a0Ant-Man, but that\u2019s a bit speculative (and that new Ant-Man\u00a0trailer was terrific). With the caveat that my opinion may not reflect the consensus, this will be at worst a bump in the road on the way to Infinity War in a few years.\u00a0I\u2019ll have plenty of time to get into more detail over the next month, along with my thoughts on the entire Marvel film library as a (net-positive) sum of its parts which will drop closer to the U.S. release date, \u00a0but I\u2019m sure you all came to read the review anyway. So, without further ado\u2026 \nMinor spoiler warning:\u00a0I tried to avoid specifics beyond the set up but there were a few things I wanted to touch on. Nothing massive, but at your peril\u2026\u00a0 \nThe Review:Avengers: Age of Ultron\u00a0plays like an obligation, a box to be checked off on a list before all parties move on to the things they really want to do. The story is shockingly inconsequential, both in terms of the overall Marvel cinematic universe and even in terms of stand-alone\u00a0Avengers\u00a0movies. It hits all the marks, providing big-scale action and the required witty banter, but there is an air of artifice and irrelevance to the whole affair. \u00a0The situations that occur in this fantastical sequel are theoretically world-changing and should be game-changing to the Marvel universe, yet the implications are either ignored or tossed off as if it were just another episode of\u00a0Avengers: Earth\u2019s Mightiest Heroes.  \nTo be absolutely fair, that this second\u00a0Avengers\u00a0adventure plays more like a \u201cmonster of the week\u201d installment as opposed to a \u201cmythology\u201d episode would be a minor quibble if it were a better film and/or if the onscreen events justified such a \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d approach. But the relative apathy\u00a0towards what occurs does not gel with the ramifications at play. The film concerns the fallout after Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) meddle with a dormant artificial intelligence program and accidentally make Ultron, a vengeful AI personified in an anthropomorphic robot form blessed with the voice of James Spader. You see, Stark originally intended to use this program to build an army of robotic peacekeepers. Not only is this strikingly similar to what Hydra tried to do in\u00a0The Winter Soldier\u00a0(preemptively eliminating threats before they reveal themselves), but\u00a0Ultron quickly decides that the best and easiest way to make the Earth safe is to eradicate humanity. \nThat Stark\u00a0(and an all-too-willing Banner) didn\u2019t consider the possibility that Ultron might reach this conclusion\u00a0makes him an idiot, and the damage done to the world renders him an indirect villain at best and a genuine threat to global stability at worst. Now if you\u2019re thinking that this is all about setting up a conflict between Stark and Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) for\u00a0Captain America: Civil War, you\u2019d be incorrect. If anything, it ignores or actively undoes status quo changes and/or character growth from\u00a0Iron Man 3\u00a0and\u00a0Captain America: The Winter Soldier (to say nothing of making his behavior in\u00a0Iron Man 2 even more reprehensible).\u00a0The narrative thrust of the film is less \u201cEarth\u2019s mightiest heroes teaming up to save the world from evil\u201d and more \u201cSee the Avengers rally together to clean a horrifying mess wholly of their own making,\u201d which is noticeably less satisfying and makes the lack of seemingly\u00a0long term\u00a0consequences all-the-more jolting.  \nThe whole thing, without revealing what does or does not occur, feels like a would-be darker, more emotionally draining sequel that feels sapped of its trauma and\u00a0impact, and thus sapped of its relevance to the ongoing story it is telling. It\u2019s not a direct comparison, but it plays a little like the theatrical cut of\u00a0Batman Forever\u00a0after WB stripped the film of its darker undertones and more reflective moments in a bid not to scare off any pint-sized fans. I certainly have no objection to an\u00a0Avengers 2\u00a0that you can show your kids, but you can\u2019t very nearly end the world due to the folly of your heroes and then (mostly) claim \u201cNo harm, no foul, nothing to see here!\u201d in\u00a0terms of\u00a0long term\u00a0impact\u00a0and character relationships. I may be spending too much discussing the lack of impact of Ultron\u2019s destructive rampage, but the feeling of dispassion frankly pervades much of the film. \nThe picture opens with a very\u00a0Expendables 2-like \u201cstorming the castle\u201d action set piece, with our heroes teamed up again and engaging in some very rubbery-looking action heroics. This stuff is fun, and if it doesn\u2019t mean much it at least gives audiences this specific kind of action sequence that we haven\u2019t really seen in a superhero movie before (a super powered team unleashing hell as a group in enemy territory). It\u2019s fun, the dialogue is peppy, and it\u2019s the kind of thing that justifies a second\u00a0Avengers\u00a0film. It is here that we are introduced to our two big new characters, specifically Quicksilver (Aaron Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). They initially are on the side of the baddies, and their one great scene involves a monologue explaining\u00a0their pretty valid reasons for hating Stark and his friends. Otherwise they are mostly potential cannon fodder and (slight third act spoiler) Scarlet Witch eventually has to be coaxed into bravery by one of the male heroes (even Megan Fox had to talk herself into action in the first\u00a0Transformers\u00a0film).  \nThe opening siege leads to a wonderful party scene, where our heroes mingle with supporting players from the other franchises and other side characters get written out with refreshing respect. It\u2019s a reminder that it\u2019s the character chemistry, not the action set pieces, that makes this universe so special. But once Ultron shows up and literally crashes the party, the fun mostly stops and the film basically goes on autopilot. James Spader basically plays a snarkier version of Raymond Reddington, which isn\u2019t a bad thing and he darn-well gives it his all in terms of making a generic robot punching bag into an engaging nemesis. But the film\u2019s many action scenes are impressively constructed and staged without any real tension or urgency. They feel less organic and more \u201cOh, we need an action beat here.\u201d It\u2019s a difficult thing to realize that you\u2019re a little bored during what should be some pretty impressive action sequences.\u00a0 \nEven the finale, which to its credit is a bit more complicated than \u201cAvengers versus a bunch of robots,\u201d and is mostly passes the \u201cnever seen that before\u201d test, lacks a ticking clock mostly because it feels like Ultron is just sitting there and waiting for the Avengers to foil his plan in precisely the way they want to. It is almost comical how loud-and-clear\u00a0the Marvel gang\u00a0heard the cries over\u00a0Man of Steel\u00a0and its massive collateral damage. That\u2019s not a criticism, but its emphasis on evacuations and keeping bystanders out of harm\u2019s way is somewhat amusingly on-the-nose. \u00a0The action sequences centered on Ultron are not particularly engaging, and frankly nor is much of the character interplay. Again, it feels like the natural results for\u00a0what transpires are swept under the rug. \nThe banter is quippy but none of the main actors, save Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, seem happy to be there. Renner of course spent most of\u00a0The Avengers\u00a0brainwashed and thus this is really his first opportunity to actually \u201cplay\u201d Hawkeye. I won\u2019t go into details, but he gets the meatiest character work and the \u201ctime out\u201d sequence centered around him\u00a0is where the film momentarily jumps back to life. Nonetheless,\u00a0Tony and Steve don\u2019t really come to blows, and Thor has a detour so he can go basically have a dream about\u00a0Avengers: Infinity War\u00a0(this is where you go to the restroom), so that leaves Bruce and Natasha. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t be annoyed that the only major female character\u2019s primary arc is a\u00a0theoretically\u00a0unrequited pining for\u00a0a nice guy with major anger issues, or that said character briefly gets captured by the villain in the second act and tossed in a cage for no reason other than to be rescued by her male compatriots, but yes stuff like that annoy\u00a0me a little, especially coming from a filmmaker who has a wholly justified reputation for playing different notes for his female characters.\u00a0 \nThat Whedon and company couldn\u2019t think of anything to do with Scarlett Johansson other than give her a romantic subplot is frankly indicative of the overall feeling of indifference that pervades the whole picture.\u00a0Avengers: Age of Ultron\u00a0is\u00a0not an aggressively bad film by any means, but it also doesn\u2019t go out of its way to be aggressively good. It lacks any impact in the overall arc and isn\u2019t all that entertaining on its own merits. Lacking either a status as a \u201cbig and important film in the Marvel mythology\u201d or a status as a \u201coutside the box stand-alone one-off,\u201d\u00a0Avengers: Age of Ultron\u00a0feels like a film that was primarily made because\u00a0The Avengers\u00a0made $1.5 billion worldwide as opposed to because it needed to exist in the narrative. Everyone involved, from the actors to the director, act like this is just a contractual obligation before they get to the meatier stuff (or vacate the premises). Other than arguably Jeremy Renner (who acts like this is the first time because it somewhat is) and Mark Ruffalo (who is incapable of giving a bad or indifferent performance), the cast of marquee heroes don\u2019t seem all that engaged after the initial half hour. \nAvengers: Age of Ultron\u00a0arguably\u00a0should have been something of a game-changer, a would-be\u00a0Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\u00a0that signaled the end of the beginning and the beginning of the end at the relative halfway point of its epic story. But instead it has all the impact of\u00a0The Expendables 2. To put it bluntly, nothing here is real, and nothing here is right. Joss Whedon and his company merely\u00a0made a\u00a0show of trading blows\u00a0and are just hoping no one knows\u00a0that they\u2019ve been going through the motions and\u00a0walking though the part.\u00a0Nothing seems to penetrate its\u00a0heart. I didn\u2019t hate\u00a0Avengers: Age of Ultron, but I did hate that I didn\u2019t like it all that much even though there was indeed blood, sweat, and tears from all involved in its creation. There are moments of wit and a few rich character beats (avoid the clips like the plague), but there are diamonds in the rough. This seemingly all-important chapter feels like a stop-gap, an intermission from a filmmaker who doesn\u2019t want to be here and a company that would rather just move on to the next big movie. I just desperately wanted it to\u00a0be\u00a0alive. \nAlso on Forbes: \n \n\u00a0 \nIf you like what you\u2019re reading, follow @ScottMendelson on Twitter, and \u201clike\u201d The Ticket Booth on Facebook.

But Kullman\u2019s big test will start in the second half of 2015, a time when proxy battles and sharp currency moves are likely to have\u00a0cooled. \nAssuming DuPont relents in its fight against Trian Management given the hedge fund\u2019s somewhat scatter-shot activist campaign, Kullman will have a lot to prove starting in July when she\u00a0spins the company\u2019s\u00a0performance chemicals division, Chemours. If the spin goes as planned, DuPont is expected to quickly return $4 billion return of capital to investors. It\u00a0will also put a spotlight on the businesses Kullman has staked DuPont\u2019s future on. \n\n Ellen Kullman, chairman and chief executive officer of DuPont Co., pauses during a session on the opening day of the World Economic Forum\n \nKullman believes spinning Chemours will be the most significant step in DuPont\u2019s transformation away from low-margin businesses and its investment in markets such as industrial biosciences, crop protection, biofuels and\u00a0high-tech materials with better growth and margin prospects. Its called the \u2018next generation DuPont,\u2019 according to Kullman, and already the company\u2019s made significant progress, both through the integration of large acquisitions such as Danisco and\u00a0a recently outlined push find over $1 billion in corporate cost savings annually. \nBut, Kullman\u2019s so-called \u2018next generation DuPont\u2019 isn\u2019t what\u2019s currently driving headlines. \nCurrency moves weighed on the company\u2019s revenue and earnings growth in the first quarter, as did a prolonged slump in the TiO2 market, which is the linchpin of its soon-to-be spun performance chemicals unit.\u00a0Trian Management, meanwhile, is seeking to air all of DuPont\u2019s apparent failures under Kullman. \nThe hedge fund wants four seats on DuPont\u2019s board so it can police Kullman. But Trian\u00a0knows calling for Kullman\u2019s ouster would be a non-starter given investors\u2019 support of her performance since taking the company\u2019s reins in 2009. Its criticisms therefore span a wide range of topics including CEO stock sales, the company\u2019s corporate structure, the magnitude of expense cuts and finicky governance issues, but its plans for a different future are somewhat murky. \nFor instance, Trian criticizes DuPont\u2019s earnings and operating margins, in addition to its under-leveraged balance sheet, but it is yet to firmly commit to proposing a wider corporate breakup or any specific operational improvements. Much of Trian\u2019s case rests on nebulous improvements such as eliminating management\u2019s rhetoric and its informational advantages. \u201cTrian believes it already has had a significant impact, but there is more value to be unlocked,\u201d the fund states. \u201cWe have a strong track record of creating value,\u201d it adds.DuPont\u2019s earnings profile is the\u00a0best illustration of both the noise impacting Kullman\u2019s work, and her opportunity to put controversy to rest. \nSince launching its activist campaign this fall, Trian\u2019s argued that DuPont\u2019s earnings per share are below 2011 levels, a disappointment. Its a striking contrast to Kullman\u2019s communications with investors. She\u00a0made the case on Tuesday that DuPont\u2019s ongoing businesses have grown adjusted operating EPS by 19% annually since 2008, while operating margins have improved from 9.5% to 16.9%. Since 2011, ongoing earnings have increased over 56% according to DuPont\u2019s calculations. \nThose differing characterizations of basic\u00a0earnings underscore just how much air can be cleared.\u00a0The \u00a0biggest drag on DuPont\u2019s EPS growth is its soon-to-be-spun performance chemicals unit Chemours. In 2011, that division and a pharma business earned $1.99 a share in adjusted operating EPS. As a result of a weak TiO2 market, the unit earned just 84-cents in 2014, however, overall operating EPS was unchanged. \nOnce freed from Chemours, Kullman will have the ability to clearly show\u00a0the earnings profile of her \u2018next generation DuPont\u2019 strategy. It will be a pivotal moment for investors and could either make or break Trian\u2019s case for change ahead of next year\u2019s proxy season. \nIn the face of currency headwinds and activist pressure, Kullman also appears to be ramping up cost saving initiatives. DuPont increased forecasts for its recently launched operational redesign, saying full-year savings are now expected to hit 40-cents, up from 35-cents previously. \nDuPont\u2019s guidance for full year-earnings is now expected to be at the low end of a $4-to-$4.20 range given an 80-cent currency impact. According to stock analysts, that means DuPont expects\u00a0to\u00a0mitigate much of its currency-related woes with an increased focus on the bottom line. \nAbout DuPont\u2019s confidence in hitting beginning of year financial targets, Credit Suisse analysts said \u201cthis modest change in\u00a0guidance in the face of much worse FX is reasonable (if they can hit it) and shows the\u00a0success of the cost cutting program.\u201d \nAssuming Kullman and DuPont succeed in casting Trian\u2019s proxy war aside, the real pressure may begin this summer as investors get a clear view on the company\u2019s long-term financial prospects. \n\u201cThere is a lot of excitement that\u2019s building in the company,\u201d\u00a0Kullman told Forbes by telephone when asked about the company\u2019s\u00a0transformation strategy. \u201cWe see proof points in the first quarter and we see momentum building,\u201d she added.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t", "newspaper": "Forbes", "id": 493, "pubdate": "Wed, 22 Apr 2015 03:49:00 +0530", "title": "DuPont CEO Ellen Kullman's Big Test Will Come After Her Battle With Trian"}, {"content": "", "newspaper": "Forbes", "id": 494, "pubdate": "Wed, 22 Apr 2015 03:20:26 +0530", "title": "Bundling Vs \u00c0 La Carte: What's The Fuss About Verizon's Skinny Bundles?"}, {"content": "\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nLast December, I wrote about Poshmark adding luxury authentication to their already-addictive mobile fashion marketplace.

Today, the company announced it has raised $25 million in new funding. \nI spoke to co-founder and VP of Merchandising Tracy Sun about how she and her team plan to spend the cash. They have no shortage of ideas: men\u2019s and children\u2019s is on the roadmap, and they\u2019re also considering beauty, international expansion, and helping women launch their own retail brands using Poshmark. \n\u201cWe started off as closets,\u201d Sun said. \u201cBut [women] have run out of inventory and have started to get reseller permits. They don\u2019t have to pay rent and are making over $100,000 selling in-season new merchandise. Now, 20 percent of sales is in-season new merchandise, and we want to get that number to 50 percent and beyond.\u201d \nThe new investment\u00a0comes from a few existing and a pair of new investors. Mayfield Fund, Menlo Ventures, Inventus Capital, and SoftTech VC re-upped, and Union Grove Venture Partners and Shea Ventures joined the round, for a total of $47.2 million in funding to date. The company, which is also backed by celebs Rachel Zoe and actor Ashton Kutcher, also announced today that it\u2019s launching an Apple Apple Watch app. \nClothing resellers seem to\u00a0pop up and go\u00a0by the wayside on the regular, so what\u2019s the secret to Poshmark\u2019s success? First: being married to mobile.\u00a0Sun says people thought they were crazy\u00a0for launching a mobile-only app, because women wouldn\u2019t shop on their phones. They now also have a website, but\u00a095 percent of users favor mobile, and \u201cmobile commerce is a given,\u201d Sun says. \nHence the company\u2019s enthusiasm for the Apple Watch, which was distributed to each of Poshmark\u2019s 80 employees. \u201cIt was a huge decision,\u201d Sun said, \u201cbut you need your team to live and breathe the vision and the innovation.\u201d She added: \u201cWe\u2019re huge believers in technology that enables peer to peer communications. The strength of Poshmark is its user-driven marketplace.\u201d \nIndeed, community has been perhaps\u00a0even more important than the mobile strategy. For the three years since it launched, Poshmark employees have logged serious miles to host\u00a0\u201dPosh Parties\u201d across the country, and users love it. \n\u201cWe\u2019re heading to New York next week for one of our bigger Posh Parties and promoting\u00a0the Apple Watch app,\u201d she said. \u201cWe continue to throw these events, and we always look to our community to help us scale.

It hits all the marks, providing big-scale action and the required witty banter, but there is an air of artifice and irrelevance to the whole affair. \u00a0The situations that occur in this fantastical sequel are theoretically world-changing and should be game-changing to the Marvel universe, yet the implications are either ignored or tossed off as if it were just another episode of\u00a0Avengers: Earth\u2019s Mightiest Heroes.  \nTo be absolutely fair, that this second\u00a0Avengers\u00a0adventure plays more like a \u201cmonster of the week\u201d installment as opposed to a \u201cmythology\u201d episode would be a minor quibble if it were a better film and/or if the onscreen events justified such a \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d approach. But the relative apathy\u00a0towards what occurs does not gel with the ramifications at play. The film concerns the fallout after Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) meddle with a dormant artificial intelligence program and accidentally make Ultron, a vengeful AI personified in an anthropomorphic robot form blessed with the voice of James Spader. You see, Stark originally intended to use this program to build an army of robotic peacekeepers. Not only is this strikingly similar to what Hydra tried to do in\u00a0The Winter Soldier\u00a0(preemptively eliminating threats before they reveal themselves), but\u00a0Ultron quickly decides that the best and easiest way to make the Earth safe is to eradicate humanity. \nThat Stark\u00a0(and an all-too-willing Banner) didn\u2019t consider the possibility that Ultron might reach this conclusion\u00a0makes him an idiot, and the damage done to the world renders him an indirect villain at best and a genuine threat to global stability at worst. Now if you\u2019re thinking that this is all about setting up a conflict between Stark and Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) for\u00a0Captain America: Civil War, you\u2019d be incorrect. If anything, it ignores or actively undoes status quo changes and/or character growth from\u00a0Iron Man 3\u00a0and\u00a0Captain America: The Winter Soldier (to say nothing of making his behavior in\u00a0Iron Man 2 even more reprehensible).\u00a0The narrative thrust of the film is less \u201cEarth\u2019s mightiest heroes teaming up to save the world from evil\u201d and more \u201cSee the Avengers rally together to clean a horrifying mess wholly of their own making,\u201d which is noticeably less satisfying and makes the lack of seemingly\u00a0long term\u00a0consequences all-the-more jolting.  \nThe whole thing, without revealing what does or does not occur, feels like a would-be darker, more emotionally draining sequel that feels sapped of its trauma and\u00a0impact, and thus sapped of its relevance to the ongoing story it is telling. It\u2019s not a direct comparison, but it plays a little like the theatrical cut of\u00a0Batman Forever\u00a0after WB stripped the film of its darker undertones and more reflective moments in a bid not to scare off any pint-sized fans. I certainly have no objection to an\u00a0Avengers 2\u00a0that you can show your kids, but you can\u2019t very nearly end the world due to the folly of your heroes and then (mostly) claim \u201cNo harm, no foul, nothing to see here!\u201d in\u00a0terms of\u00a0long term\u00a0impact\u00a0and character relationships. I may be spending too much discussing the lack of impact of Ultron\u2019s destructive rampage, but the feeling of dispassion frankly pervades much of the film. \nThe picture opens with a very\u00a0Expendables 2-like \u201cstorming the castle\u201d action set piece, with our heroes teamed up again and engaging in some very rubbery-looking action heroics. This stuff is fun, and if it doesn\u2019t mean much it at least gives audiences this specific kind of action sequence that we haven\u2019t really seen in a superhero movie before (a super powered team unleashing hell as a group in enemy territory). It\u2019s fun, the dialogue is peppy, and it\u2019s the kind of thing that justifies a second\u00a0Avengers\u00a0film. It is here that we are introduced to our two big new characters, specifically Quicksilver (Aaron Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). They initially are on the side of the baddies, and their one great scene involves a monologue explaining\u00a0their pretty valid reasons for hating Stark and his friends. Otherwise they are mostly potential cannon fodder and (slight third act spoiler) Scarlet Witch eventually has to be coaxed into bravery by one of the male heroes (even Megan Fox had to talk herself into action in the first\u00a0Transformers\u00a0film).  \nThe opening siege leads to a wonderful party scene, where our heroes mingle with supporting players from the other franchises and other side characters get written out with refreshing respect. It\u2019s a reminder that it\u2019s the character chemistry, not the action set pieces, that makes this universe so special. But once Ultron shows up and literally crashes the party, the fun mostly stops and the film basically goes on autopilot. James Spader basically plays a snarkier version of Raymond Reddington, which isn\u2019t a bad thing and he darn-well gives it his all in terms of making a generic robot punching bag into an engaging nemesis. But the film\u2019s many action scenes are impressively constructed and staged without any real tension or urgency. They feel less organic and more \u201cOh, we need an action beat here.\u201d It\u2019s a difficult thing to realize that you\u2019re a little bored during what should be some pretty impressive action sequences.\u00a0 \nEven the finale, which to its credit is a bit more complicated than \u201cAvengers versus a bunch of robots,\u201d and is mostly passes the \u201cnever seen that before\u201d test, lacks a ticking clock mostly because it feels like Ultron is just sitting there and waiting for the Avengers to foil his plan in precisely the way they want to. It is almost comical how loud-and-clear\u00a0the Marvel gang\u00a0heard the cries over\u00a0Man of Steel\u00a0and its massive collateral damage. That\u2019s not a criticism, but its emphasis on evacuations and keeping bystanders out of harm\u2019s way is somewhat amusingly on-the-nose. \u00a0The action sequences centered on Ultron are not particularly engaging, and frankly nor is much of the character interplay. Again, it feels like the natural results for\u00a0what transpires are swept under the rug. \nThe banter is quippy but none of the main actors, save Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, seem happy to be there. Renner of course spent most of\u00a0The Avengers\u00a0brainwashed and thus this is really his first opportunity to actually \u201cplay\u201d Hawkeye. I won\u2019t go into details, but he gets the meatiest character work and the \u201ctime out\u201d sequence centered around him\u00a0is where the film momentarily jumps back to life. Nonetheless,\u00a0Tony and Steve don\u2019t really come to blows, and Thor has a detour so he can go basically have a dream about\u00a0Avengers: Infinity War\u00a0(this is where you go to the restroom), so that leaves Bruce and Natasha. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t be annoyed that the only major female character\u2019s primary arc is a\u00a0theoretically\u00a0unrequited pining for\u00a0a nice guy with major anger issues, or that said character briefly gets captured by the villain in the second act and tossed in a cage for no reason other than to be rescued by her male compatriots, but yes stuff like that annoy\u00a0me a little, especially coming from a filmmaker who has a wholly justified reputation for playing different notes for his female characters.\u00a0 \nThat Whedon and company couldn\u2019t think of anything to do with Scarlett Johansson other than give her a romantic subplot is frankly indicative of the overall feeling of indifference that pervades the whole picture.\u00a0Avengers: Age of Ultron\u00a0is\u00a0not an aggressively bad film by any means, but it also doesn\u2019t go out of its way to be aggressively good. It lacks any impact in the overall arc and isn\u2019t all that entertaining on its own merits. Lacking either a status as a \u201cbig and important film in the Marvel mythology\u201d or a status as a \u201coutside the box stand-alone one-off,\u201d\u00a0Avengers: Age of Ultron\u00a0feels like a film that was primarily made because\u00a0The Avengers\u00a0made $1.5 billion worldwide as opposed to because it needed to exist in the narrative. Everyone involved, from the actors to the director, act like this is just a contractual obligation before they get to the meatier stuff (or vacate the premises). Other than arguably Jeremy Renner (who acts like this is the first time because it somewhat is) and Mark Ruffalo (who is incapable of giving a bad or indifferent performance), the cast of marquee heroes don\u2019t seem all that engaged after the initial half hour. \nAvengers: Age of Ultron\u00a0arguably\u00a0should have been something of a game-changer, a would-be\u00a0Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\u00a0that signaled the end of the beginning and the beginning of the end at the relative halfway point of its epic story. But instead it has all the impact of\u00a0The Expendables 2. To put it bluntly, nothing here is real, and nothing here is right. Joss Whedon and his company merely\u00a0made a\u00a0show of trading blows\u00a0and are just hoping no one knows\u00a0that they\u2019ve been going through the motions and\u00a0walking though the part.\u00a0Nothing seems to penetrate its\u00a0heart. I didn\u2019t hate\u00a0Avengers: Age of Ultron, but I did hate that I didn\u2019t like it all that much even though there was indeed blood, sweat, and tears from all involved in its creation. There are moments of wit and a few rich character beats (avoid the clips like the plague), but there are diamonds in the rough. This seemingly all-important chapter feels like a stop-gap, an intermission from a filmmaker who doesn\u2019t want to be here and a company that would rather just move on to the next big movie. I just desperately wanted it to\u00a0be\u00a0alive. \nAlso on Forbes: \n \n\u00a0 \nIf you like what you\u2019re reading, follow @ScottMendelson on Twitter, and \u201clike\u201d The Ticket Booth on Facebook.

Some of the stocks in the fast-growing sector are more alluring than many others, but make no mistake: Biotechs should not be ignored! \n\u201cBiotech stocks are still in favor with investors for all the right reasons: constant M&amp;A, solid clinical data, regulatory reviews, upcoming scientific conferences, selective stock picking, and technical support,\u201d says veteran biotech analyst John McCamant, who is also editor of the Medical Technology Stock Letter, in Berkeley, California. \nThe announcement this morning that Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) has offered to acquire Mylan NV (MYL) for $82 a share, or $40 billion, is the latest example of the rash of M&amp;As in the biotech arena. \n\u201cThe abundant cash flow from unprecedented takeovers and even share buybacks,\u201d notes McCamant, \u201ccoupled with positive fundamentals despite high valuations make us sound like broken record \u2013 biotech sentiment is high.\u201d \nHe notes that the pullback in biotech stocks at the end of the first quarter \u201cdidn\u2019t break the index\u2019s technical support levels and, if anything, appears to have created attractive opportinities at flush hedge and mutual funds and individuals to put cash back into the sector,\u201d says McCamant. Right now, these two are the standout biotech stocks which M&amp;A traders as well as opportunistic investors are focusing on. \nHow do you play this latest biotech development \u2014 and which stocks are a must-buy right now? \nTeva\u2019s offer to acquire Mylan has prompted S&amp;P Capital IQ to reiterate its buy recommendation on Mylan. One reason: Teva will have to sweeten the pot, which means Mylan\u2019s stock potentially faces more upside swing. \n\u201cTeva would need to raise its (stock-and-cash) offer price and lower the stock component to get Mylan to agree to an offer,\u201d says Jeffrey Loo, analyst at S&amp;P Capital IQ. So he has raised his price target for Mylan by $13 a share, to $92, or 22 times his 2015 earnings estimate. Since the buyout announcement, Mylan\u2019s stock has jumped as of yesterday 8.77%, to $74 a share. Teva\u2019s stock also leaped, to $64, up 1.25%.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tPage 1 / 2\n\n\t\t\t\tContinue \n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t", "newspaper": "Forbes", "id": 498, "pubdate": "Wed, 22 Apr 2015 02:26:00 +0530", "title": "Two Stocks Stand Out In Red-Hot But Volatile Biotech Sector"}, {"content": "\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWith millions of records sold, dozens of awards won and a handful of exes to thank for inspiration, Taylor Swift has arguably become pop music\u2019s most recognizable artist. The 25-year-old superstar will begin her massive 1989 World Tour in Tokyo in two weeks and is slated to hit North America late next month, where she will invade the U.S. and Canada through October. Swift will continue adding to her resume through the fall months as she embarks on one of the secondary ticket market\u2019s most expensive tours of the year. \nAccording to TiqIQ, the average secondary price for Taylor Swift tickets over her five-month 1989 Tour through North America is $315.41. Swift\u2019s exorbitant ticket average trumps that of her previous two tours on the secondary market, with her Red Tour averaging $171.19 and Speak Now Tour owning a $177.73 average. Only Madonna\u2019s upcoming Rebel Heart World Tour will have a more expensive average on the secondary market this year at $324.96. \nShe\u2019ll play her top-priced show at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on August 22. Taylor Swift tickets at the Staples Center currently average $529.88 on the secondary market, 67.9% above the tour average, and the get-in price starts at $128.

While there is no doubt that she has the reach to fill 60,000+ capacity venues, she is one of the few artists to retain big prices with tens of thousands more tickets made available to the public. Family band HAIM will join Swift for a few of her stadium stops, which is likely allowing ticket prices to remain firm (if not increase) on those select dates. \nConversely, the \u201cBlank Space\u201d singer\u2019s cheapest tour dates will be held at North Dakota\u2019s Fargodome on September 9, Iowa\u2019s Wells Fargo Arena on October 8 and her opening U.S. show at the CenturyLink Center in Louisiana on May 22.

Last year\u2019s earnings peaked at $5.57, but it could be 2017 before SLB approaches that number, again. \nI am cursed with extended institutional memory. Decades ago, management used its cash to diversify out of oil service. They bought Fairchild Camera in 1979 at the top of the semiconductor cycle. Nowadays, they buy back stock, but not enough to make me deliriously happy. Any future deals surely focus on oil service properties. \nMid-2014, management at its investor get-together, when WTI oil futures ticked at $110 a barrel, felt comfortable projecting earnings power a few years out at $9 to $10 a share. They saw stable commodity pricing and little or no price concessions coming from oil service purveyors. \nAlas! I believed Paal Kibsgaard, its headman, held the key to stardom. I told my trader to buy 100 shares for each of our grandchildren, counting at 7, this October at 8. SLB peaked around $118 then, but now ticks at $92. \nSo, my grandchildren, you\u2019ve gotten your initial lesson in money management. Never believe everything you hear at a management sponsored meeting. At the least, take their numbers down by 10%, but in this case, much more. \nSchlumberger probably won\u2019t earn $9 or $10 a share looking out at least 5 years, unless geopolitical fireworks go off in the Middle East, curtailing production by 2 million barrels a day. SLB can claw back to earn over $5 a share when WTI oil futures bounce to $80 to $90 a barrel a year or 2 out. The stock in the low nineties is saying as much. Historically, SLB trades at a premium to the S&amp;P 500 Index, now at 17 times. When $6 a share is in sight, the stock can easily move into triple digits, again. \nKibsgaard referred to his work force as the best in the industry, yet he did terminate 20,000 over the past 6 months, when Brent oil quotes sloughed off from over $110 a barrel in June \u201914 to $45 this January. \nThe market likes solidly franchised cyclical growth properties. So do I, with sizable positions in Dow Chemical Dow Chemical, Boeing Boeing, United Technologies United Technologies, Honeywell, Cisco Systems, Walt Disney and Apple.

The 20.4% sales growth, too, looks less impressive upon further inspection: it\u2019s down from 27% growth last quarter and down from the 24% pop reported for the year-ago quarter. \nSame-store sales increased 10.4%, but slowed on a quarter-by-quarter basis: the first quarter\u2019s result is\u00a0down\u00a0from the 16.1% growth reported in the fourth quarter of 2014 and from 19.8% in 2014\u2032s third quarter. The company said that comparable sales growth was driven by an increase in check size (due to a menu price increase that took full effect during the second quarter of 2014) as well as increased foot traffic.\u00a0 \nNet income for the quarter, however, was more of a bright spot for the chain: Chipotle reported $122.6 million in net income for the quarter, a figure that\u2019s up 47.6% year-over-year and resulted\u00a0in earnings of $3.88 per share, a figure that easily beat the $3.66 per-share analyst consensus. \n\u201cWe are very proud of our start to 2015, as our average sales volumes reached a record $2.5 million per restaurant,\u201d Steve Ellis, Chipotle\u2019s founder, chairman and CEO, said in a statement Tuesday afternoon. \u201cThe quarter was not without its challenges,\u201d he added, \u201cas we suspended one of our primary pork suppliers and are exploring options to increase the supply of pork that meets our high standards. But we remain confident that higher quality, \u2018responsibly raised\u2019\u00a0ingredients taste better and will continue to resonate with our customers.\u201d \nChipotle also said Tuesday that it added 49 restaurants during the quarter, bringing its restaurant count to 1,831. \nThe company affirmed the full-year 2015 outlook it provided in February, saying that it continues to predict full-year same-store sales growth in the \u201clow to mid single digits,\u201d down from the 16.8% same-store sales growth it experienced in 2014.

Revenues excluding payments to website partners for traffic fell again, to $1.04 billion, a little under forecasts of $1.06 billion. \nIn a prepared statement, CEO Mayer cited \u201cencouraging\u201d revenue on a GAAP basis of 8%. Although display revenues rose only 2%, search was up 20% and mobile revenues jumped 61% from a year ago to $234 million. \n\u201cYahoo is amidst a multi-year transformation to return an iconic company to greatness,\u201d\u00a0Mayer said in the statement. \u201cFor the next phase of the transformation, we will focus on accelerating our GAAP revenue growth while managing our margins and costs.\u201d \nIn short, surging growth in newer kinds of ads, especially on mobile devices, isn\u2019t yet making up for a long decline in search and display ads. Last year Mayer declared an emphasis on so-called Mavens ads\u2013mobile, video, social, and native\u2013but they\u2019re still quite small in comparison with the established ad formats. However, Mavens revenues, reported separately for the first time, rose 58%, to $363 million, or 22% of ad revenues. Revenues from non-Mavens ads, or display and search ads, fell 7%, to $744 million. \n\n Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer at a mobile event in February.\n \nYahoo\u2019s shares, which had declined today a fraction of 1%, to $44.49, fell about 1.5% in trading shortly after the market close. Later, halfway through the earnings conference call, they were rising as much as 1.4%, possibly thanks to a promise by Mayer that she would find a way to extract value from Yahoo\u2019s $7 billion stake in Yahoo Japan Yahoo Japan. They had declined 7% in the first quarter. \nYahoo\u2019s\u00a0disappointing earnings follow an announcement April 16 that it had revamped\u00a0its search advertising deal with Microsoft Microsoft to give it more flexibility to sell its own search ads. While the impact of that deal won\u2019t show up until at least the current quarter, Yahoo has benefited somewhat from a deal to become the Web browser Firefox\u2019s default browser.

In search, the number of paid clicks rose 21% from a year ago thanks to the Firefox deal, while price per click was up 3%. In display, the number of ads sold rose 29%, though price per ad fell 17%.

Spot gold was up 1 percent at $1,206.46 an ounce by 2:23 p.m. EDT (1823 GMT). Flat initially, it gained momentum after a break of technical resistance at $1,196 that triggered automatic buy orders. \"This move is coming during a week when we didn't really have any gold-positive news but ...the way gold is putting up a fight at the moment is potentially giving some confidence to the market,\" Saxo Bank senior manager Ole Hansen said. \"But to make headwinds above the resistance area around $1,225 we need to see some real buying coming in.\" Bullion was still down around 0.3 percent for the week, however, having pulled back from Monday's seven-week high of $1,224.10, reached after last week's weak US employment report.

But the longer-term outlook is still bearish, traders said, and prices had surrendered gains after Federal Reserve officials suggested a June rate hike could still be in play.

GE stock jumped 8.5 percent.\"The stock has been under-owned by institutional investors, and that's going to change now,\" said Tom Donino, co-head of equity trading at First New York Securities.The repurchase program, which will be partly funded by $35 billion through money returned from GE Capital, is the second-biggest in history after Apple Inc's $90 billion plan. GE, which had 10.06 billion shares outstanding on Jan. 31, said it expected to reduce that by as much as 20 percent to 8 billion to 8.5 billion by 2018.\n        \n        In all, GE said it planned to shed $275 billion in GE Capital assets. That includes the previously announced spinoff of its Synchrony Financial credit card unit, the real estate transaction announced on Friday, and future sales of commercial lending and consumer banking businesses with assets of about $165 billion.The company plans to keep $90 billion in finance assets directly related to selling its products such as jet engines, medical equipment and power generation and electrical grid gear.GE has forecast earnings of $1.70 to $1.80 per share for this year, including 60 cents from GE Capital, but expects profit to be \u201csubstantially higher\u201d in 2018, executives said on a conference call with analysts. Shrinking GE Capital will reduce earnings by 25 cents per share, they said, but the stock buybacks should offset that impact.The company already had a significant number of inquiries about GE Capital units before Friday\u2019s announcement, said Keith Sherin, the finance unit's chief.\n        \n        Blackstone Group LP and Wells Fargo &amp; Co confirmed that they were buying most of the assets of GE Capital Real Estate for about $23 billion.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This is the biggest deal in the commercial property market since Blackstone's acquisition of office landlord Equity Office Properties Trust in 2007 for $39 billion, including debt.FOCUS ON INDUSTRIALThe moves announced on Friday will dramatically reduce GE\u2019s exposure to lending and other financial businesses.GE Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt told investors the company would try to generate 90 percent of its profits from industrial operations by 2018. He had previously forecast that share would grow to 75 percent by 2016 from 55 percent in 2013.\u201cWe just think the market timing is very good vis-a-vis the value of financial service assets,\u201d Immelt said in an interview. \u201cThere have been moments in the past when there weren\u2019t a lot of buyers. Now there are.\u201d Immelt and other GE executives said they planned to spend $3 billion to $5 billion a year on industrial acquisitions.GE said it could return up to $90 billion to investors through a combination of dividends, the $50 billion in share buybacks, and completion of the Synchrony spinoff planned for late this year.\tExecutives gave several reasons for GE's accelerated retreat from financial businesses. One is that since the financial crisis, it has become more difficult for GE to fund its lending operations.GE funded many of its loans and leases by borrowing money from bond markets. During the financial crisis it lost access to that funding, bringing it uncomfortably close to running out of cash. Lenders like GE Capital and CIT Group Inc, which cannot rely on bank deposits to fund their assets, have had to rethink the way they do business since the crisis. Many decided to either shed assets or become banks.GE Capital\u2019s size and the potential risks in its lending portfolio made it subject to government regulation as a systemically important financial institution. GE said it would apply to escape that oversight in 2016 as it reduces the financial business' size. GE said it would take after-tax charges of about $16 billion for the restructuring in the first quarter, of which about $12 billion would be non-cash.Shares of GE were sluggish for the past year despite previous moves to reposition itself around the industrial businesses. Still, Friday\u2019s more dramatic move away from finance caught some analysts by surprise.\"What we did not expect was the speed with which management would move to undertake this transformation,\" Sanford Bernstein analyst Steven Winoker wrote. \"We view today's announcement as an overwhelming positive for the company.\"During the conference call, Barclays analyst Scott Davis told executives that while he had been a critic, \u201cthis is good stuff ... I guess you can keep your jobs a little longer.\"JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co and Centerview Partners provided general financial advice to GE, while Bank of America Corp and Kimberlite Advisors advised on the real estate deal.

If it goes through, it could float another, with an overall target to sell 30,000 bales this cotton year (October 2014\u2013September 2015).CCI has procured 9.1 million bales this year so far at the government's minimum support price, surpassing the previous record of 8.9 mn in 2008-09.

A case has already been filed by FTIL at the high court (HC) in Mumbai against the merger. The draft order was made on October 21 last year, to merge NSEL with FTIL in the public interest, under Section 396 of the Companies Act, 1956. This was in the wake of the Rs 5,574 crore payment fraud at NSEL, in which FTIL holds a 99.99 per cent stake.The government, in its assessment order, has analysed share prices of NSEL and FTIL and came to a fair value of Rs 77 a share and Rs 208 a share, respectively.

Indeed, if the trend continues, we could well buy more than 30,000 electric vehicles this year alone.But the good news is also the bad: The government's \u00a35,000 subsidy on each new car will run out when a total of 50,000 have been sold - and that target could now be reached before the end of the year.

Then there were just six; now there are 27 models which qualify for the government grant.The network of charging points has also expanded. There are now 3,000 places in the UK where you can plug in, and by doing so take advantage of motoring costs as low as 2p a mile.\"It's a classic rolling boulder,\" says Jim Holder, the editor of What Car? magazine.\"More manufacturers have come in, the infrastructure has grown, and there are a lot of incentives behind buying a car.\"Those incentives have been key: Road tax exemption, free entry to London's congestion zone, and the fact that the government currently pays  as much as \u00a35,000 towards the cost of a car - the plug-in grant. Company car tax rates are also much lower (see below).But beware. By my calculations, based on government and the SMMT figures, 31,000 plug-in grants have now been paid - leaving another 19,000 before the scheme ends.Given that we bought 8,500 eligible cars in the first three months of 2015, the grants may well run out by the Autumn.  If you're thinking of going electric, it may pay you to put your foot down.The scheme is due to be reviewed in May, but as yet no one knows whether the subsidy will be extended.\n                        Larry Wood believes customers will still buy electric cars, even without the subsidy\n                    \n                Car taxAt his show-room in north London, car dealer Larry Wood, of Hummingbird Motors, is unperturbed. The main reason is that Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV - a plug-in hybrid SUV - has proved so popular.It is now Britain's best-selling electric car, with more than 10,000 sales in the last year. He believes customers won't stop buying them, even if the plug-in grant is no longer available.\"If that does run out in the future, I still think people will buy these cars, but it just makes them \u00a35,000 cheaper,\" he says.In any case, some of his best customers are businesses, for whom the capital cost is not the only consideration. The main attraction for them is a lower rate of car tax. While the most polluting cars pay 35% in company car tax, electric cars - even though they used to be exempt - pay 5%.As a result, any business with a fleet of vehicles could still save thousands of pounds a year by going electric.TechnologyMost of the problems initially associated with electric vehicles are gradually being resolved, or so the industry would have you believe.\"Range anxiety\" - the fear of running out of charge - does not apply if you buy a hybrid car, which switches to its conventional engine as soon as the battery runs out of power.Nevertheless, those who drive pure electric cars still worry about getting stranded. \"Range anxiety will never go away,\" says Jim Holder.But ranges are being extended. Whereas a maximum range of 100 miles used to be typical, the latest cars offer well over that. General Motors hopes that its Bolt model, currently on the drawing board, will have a 200 mile range.The super-expensive Tesla S - already on sale in the UK - will go for 310 miles without a charge, according to the manufacturer.Another problem has been the cost of batteries, the main reason that electric cars are so pricey in the first place.But advances in technology could make them cost-competitive with petrol engines in less than a decade, according to two Swedish scientists.\n                        Tesla's fast-charge station in Maidstone, Kent\n                    \n                'Ferrari'Time spent charging has been another bugbear of electric motorists - if you can find a charge point of course.The government boasts there are now 7,000 in the UK, in 3,000 locations. 500 of those are \"fast chargers\", which can offer a 50% charge in as little as 20 minutes.But in reality, most charging stops are going to be for at least half an hour.And for motorists, understanding the rival charge point networks - and the different costs for using them - still requires some tenacity.Public subsidies for infrastructure have also changed, with the government ending its specific grant of up to \u00a37,500 per charge point.However, there is still some support available for owners under the Electric Vehicle Homecharge Scheme, which pays householders up to \u00a3700 to have a charge point installed at home.What is undeniable is that the appeal of the cars themselves has certainly improved.Where once electric cars looked like garden shed conversions, the designers of BMW and Porsche have now worked magic.Performance too has improved significantly. \"You now get instant torque away from the traffic lights,\" says Jim Holder. \"Frankly, not even a Ferrari will beat you off the line.\"\n    ", "newspaper": "BBC", "id": 555, "pubdate": "Sat, 11 Apr 2015 02:32:14 +0530", "title": "Electric car buyers 'need to hurry'"}, {"content": "With the  stock markets remaining on a strong wicket, companies are finally getting into IPO (initial public offering) mode.

The Catholic Syrian Bank, Amar Ujala Publications and Prabhat Dairy are among them. Despite a strong rally in the markets following the formation of a stable government at the Centre, companies raised a meagre Rs 3,019 crore from  IPOs in 2014-15. There were no big-ticket markets debuts during the year either. Only eight mainboard IPOs hit the market collectively raising just Rs 2,769 crore in 2014-15. This included only one Rs 1,000-crore plus IPO (Inox Wind--Rs 1,020 crore). The highest-ever mobilization through IPOs was in 2007-08 when companies raised Rs 41,323 crore. Fund-raising from equity markets doubled to hit a five-year high of Rs 58,801 crore in 2014-15 despite a lacklustre showing by IPOs. There has, however, been some improvement on the IPO front with companies turning active in filings from the third week of March. \"The markets are remaining quite strong. The confidence about growth is also still there.

If the business is good and valuations are right, companies would get good response from IPOs,\" he says.    But unlike in the past, IPOs will not get overwhelming response from investors, say experts. \"There will be selective investor interest in IPOs,\" Haldea says. Incidentally, the IPO of Adlabs Entertainment managed to scrape through only on its final day last month after it reduced the offer price and extended the offer period by three days. As many as 103 companies, which received approval from Sebi since April 2009 to collectively raise Rs 48,150 crore, allowed these to lapse despite approvals being valid for a period of one year as markets remained lacklustre for nearly three years. In addition, 58 companies which had filed their offer documents with Sebi since April 2009 to collectively raise Rs 17,685 crore withdrew their offer documents.

Spot gold was flat at $1,206.93 an ounce by 0212 GMT.  Bullion climbed 1.1 percent on Friday as bulls attempted to push the price past the $1,210 resistance level. US gold for June delivery was up 0.2 percent at $1,207.20 an ounce.

In the international market, platinum is trailing gold at $1,166.50 an ounce against gold's $1,200 an ounce. However, as platinum is not listed on the Indian commodity exchanges, it is difficult to track its price on a daily basis. Till 2002-03, jewellers used to sell platinum at a fixed price.Now each  jeweller has a price of the day and there can be a difference of 4-5% in platinum rates from store to store. With prices dropping just before the May-June wedding season, the demand for the rare metal has risen by almost 8%. However, before you head out to buy, keep the following points in mind.Though the outlook for the metal is bullish, with a price rise of 15 to 20% expected this year, it is a good idea to buy platinum in small proportions to start with. If you are keen on investing in the white metal, you need to procure made-to-order coins and bars. However, they are not easy to sell as there aren't too many ready buyers and the market is not mature enough.  According to  Vaishali Banerjee, Country Manager of Platinum Guild International (India), the price depression is good news for buyers of jewellery. Platinum jewellery is hallmarked\u2014Pt950 denotes 95% purity. The remaining 5% is an alloy of platinum group metals like palladium and rhodium. Banerjee advises buying platinum only from The Platinum Guild International-authorised jewellers, the list of which is mentioned on the guild's website. Platinum products are also authenticated by a third-party certification, the  Underwriters Laboratories, also known as the UL card. Insist on this card from the jeweller to authenticate your purchase.Too high a priceThe making charge of platinum jewellery is around 10-30% more than gold. The more intricate the design, the more it costs to make.\"There is high wastage or manufacturing loss during the making process. As the metal is very dense, it requires highly-skilled workers to make jewellery out of it. A platinum jewellery worker can make gold jewellery, but not vice versa. Also the alloys that go into platinum jewellery are as expensive as platinum. Silver and copper alloy used in gold jewellery are cheaper than gold,\" says  Vastupal Ranka, Director,  Ranka Jewellers (West).Moreover, jewellers are not allowed to make platinum jewellery in-house. According to  Kalpanik Chokshi, Director, Ishwarlal Harjivandas Jewellers, Ahmedabad, platinum jewellery is manufactured by Platinum Guild International. Authorised jewellers have to place an order with the guild to procure a piece. As platinum is a hard metal, it requires a high melting point and can only be handled in specialised manufacturing units.The buyback policy for platinum is similar to that of gold, but there is no standardisation, with each jeweller following his own policy. A hallmarked piece can be exchanged for jewellery or cash at an authorised store.You will get back 85-90% of the value of platinum. In case of gold, the deduction is 0.5%. As a result of the downsides, the demand for platinum is largely concentrated to bigger cities. Even in Mumbai and Pune, less than 1% of all jewellers sell platinum jewellery.The Platinum Guild International (India) is also particular about who can sell the metal.For those attracted to platinum because of its look, a safer option could be white gold, which has a matured market in India. However, the white look of white gold can wear off over time, unlike platinum.The good part about platinum not being traded in India is there is no price speculation around it like in the case of gold.

Now, after a gap of more than a year, government agencies are lining up nearly Rs 40,000 crores of bonds in the next few months, but the yields may be lower by as much as a one-and-a-half percentage points, thanks to falling  interest rates and rising investor appetite for such bonds.  Indian Railways Finance Corporation (IRFC), may obtain the highest allocation of about Rs 15,000-17,000 crore to issue such securities aimed at tapping retail money to meet the country's infrastructure needs.The rate of interest is likely to be in the range of 7-7.25% with a spread or gap of 75-85 basis points below the ten-year benchmark bond yield. These rates are lower than 8.75-9% that such bonds offered in fiscal 2014. However, tax is not payable on the interest earned on such bonds, making them look more attractive than taxable debt instruments. \"Tax-free bonds will evince interest from retail investors, but it has to come at the right time before interest rates slid further,\" said Ajay Manglunia,  senior vice-president at  Edelweiss Securities. \"Any rate above 7% is enough to attract retail investors, who are mostly long-term investors,\" he said. \"Some high net worth individuals too would be investing with an aim for capital appreciation.\"The government has already approved state-owned IRFC and the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI), to sell such bonds.Railway minister Suresh Prabhu has announced ambitious plans to revamp the ailing railways, and has promised even bullet trains. In his Budget speech, he had said that about Rs 1.27 lakh crore would be spent on renovating tracks and other safety measures, and Rs 7.29 lakh crore on capital expenditure next five years. The ministry also intends to fast track the sanctioned works on 7,000 km of double/third/fourth lines and commission 1,200 km in 2015-16 at an investment of Rs 8,686 crore. Prabhu had also announced plans to focus on PPPs to meet the funding gap.So is the case with NHAI. Roads minister Nitin Gadkari has targeted to award 15,000 kms of roads in two fiscals by March 2016. The target was at 8,500 km in 2014-15. The government is also working on hybrid models to raise funds for these projects since many of the companies in this segment are already sunk in debt. For the irrigation sector, many including  National Bank for Agriculture and Development (Nabard), Housing and Urban Development Corporation (Hudco), Rural Electrification Corporation (REC) and India Infrastructure Finance Company (IIFCL), have proposed to the economic affairs and finance ministries for approval to tap the bond market.

It is difficult to give a number but there may be a slowdown which may have an effect on oil coming from the U.S. in 2016,\" he said.Birol wants to build stronger ties with emerging economies such as India, China, Indonesia and Mexico and if possible bring  these countries into any joint IEA emergency supply response.IEA's 29 member nations jointly accounted for some 70 percent of global oil demand when it was formed 41 years ago.

They hope it will bring in 10 billion euros ($10.75 billion), half of it from foreign visitors.Some 9 million tickets have already been sold, a third of them outside Italy, for an event seeking to broaden its appeal with interactive exhibits such as a supermarket of the future, cultural events and shows at an arena and an artificial lake.\"Expo will be the litmus test for the great ambitions which Italy has,\" Renzi said in a speech in Milan last month to promote the event. \"With the Expo, we'll be able to see what Italy will be in the coming years.\"Intended as a celebration of Milan's openness to the world and an exploration of new approaches to sustainable food, the event has so far stood out for the chronic corruption and waste that have blighted public works projects in Italy for decades.Several top officials, including the Expo's former public procurement manager, were arrested last year and the whole event was placed under the oversight of the national anti-bribery authority in a bid to ensure transparency.\"REALISTICALLY CONFIDENT\"The Italian pavilion, a centerpiece of the event, was originally expected to cost 63 million euros ($67.69 million) but will end up costing 92 million and may not be completed in time. A number of transport projects planned to accompany Expo will also not be ready.A defendant who opened fire in a Milan court last week, killing three people including a judge, also underlined the potential security problems around a major event of this size.Buffeted by the scandals and facing disputes with architects and building contractors, Expo Commissioner Giuseppe Sala says construction work at the 110-hectare (272 acre) greenfield site on the outskirts of Milan will be essentially complete by opening day.\"I am realistically confident about the work we're doing but I am surprised and sometimes a bit disconcerted by the climate which has developed,\" he told reporters in Milan earlier this month, denying press reports that organizers would be forced to hide embarrassing gaps with camouflage panels.\"When has it ever been the case for a project like an Expo or Olympic Games, that all the building work has been finished 30 days before the opening?\" he said. \"If we end up looking bad, the fault will be mine. The government and local partners have done everything they should.\"CHINA PRESENCEIn all, 145 countries are taking part but China, a growing presence in the Italian economy following a spree of acquisitions ranging from luxury yacht maker Ferretti to tyre maker Pirelli, will be particularly well represented.As well as a 5,000 square meter official pavilion, there are separate halls for property developer Vanke and other Chinese corporations. A million tickets have already been sold in China, adding to a rising flow of Chinese visitors to Italy.\"A Milan delegation went to China two months ago and was given a rapturous welcome,\" said Claudio Artusi, who is coordinating Milan's plans for events across the city.\"Getting visas is a bit of a bottleneck, but the Chinese are keen to have the chance of explaining the country to those who don\u2019t know it.\"  In the noise and confusion of the building site, it is still hard to picture how it will all look, although the intricate woodwork of the Japanese pavilion and the futuristic swoop of France's hall suggest an eye-catching architectural display.Visitors will see exhibits on \"feeding the planet\" with plant samples and technology, while dozens of restaurants will give a taste of various national cuisines including Italian specialties from the upmarket delicatessen chain Eataly.But Expo will also have plenty of room for the mass-produced food industry. Both Coca-Cola and McDonald's are hosting pavilions, fuelling worries that the green-tinged rhetoric of \"sustainability\" will hide a familiar big-money business agenda.A \"No Expo\" movement is already planning protests for the May 1 opening, and even away from anti-globalization groups there has been criticism about the capacity of a mega-spectacle like Expo to promote more eco-friendly agriculture. Slow Food, a campaign group which has done much to promote sustainable and traditional foods, is taking part to press its message against waste and over-industrialized production, but it remains skeptical about many aspects of the event.\"It was absurd to have used 1 million square meters of ground that was not cemented over, that was still fertile, to construct the Expo site,\" said Roberto Burdese, head of the group's Italian section.\"But you can't leave an empty seat at the discussion table.

For a change, however, there are reasons for hope in the euro currency bloc, despite still low growth and high unemployment.European Central Bank President Mario Draghi will be able to claim an early success in the bank's fledgling money printing program with figures on Friday set to confirm that falling prices throughout the 19-country euro zone are beginning to stabilize. Bank lending too is improving.\"We're seeing the opposite of 2014,\" said Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING bank. \"Now there are more doubts about the U.S. and China than the euro zone.\"The ECB's long-awaited scheme to buy 60 billion euros a month of chiefly government bonds is also helping to steady nerves in wrangling with debt-strapped Greece.Greece has until mid-week to improve a package of reforms required for the release of euro zone loans that it needs to stay afloat, and that will be a hot topic in Washington.Were Greece to tumble out of the currency union, it could upset an already delicate global picture where even the U.S. economy, a beacon of economic strength, is losing some of its shine.SOBER PROSPECTSOn Tuesday, the United States will release March retail sales data. Although economists expect a rebound, shoppers are being cautious, holding back much of the savings made on lower petrol prices.Consumer inflation, one way of taking the pulse of the economy, has also slowed as oil prices drop.But even stripping out the impact of energy prices and the cost of food, analysts expect only a 0.1 percent month-on-month gain in U.S. consumer prices in March, due on Friday.Such signs of a sagging economy, including disappointingly low hiring last month, are leading investors to bet that the Federal Reserve will wait before hiking the cost of borrowing until October or even December.Many had previously pencilled in a mid-year U.S. rate hike, which will be the first in more than eight years and likely to send ripples around the globe. For many of the central bankers and officials attending the IMF meeting, the later the United States moves to hike rates the better.The IMF's economic outlook report, due early in the week, will likely make for sober reading.China, previously the main growth engine for the world economy, is likely to continue to slow despite two recent interest rate cuts.On Wednesday, the world's second-largest economy will unveil its economic output for the first quarter, alongside readings of factory activity, retail sales and investment.Economists expect growth slowed to 7 percent in January-March. Although far stronger than Europe or the United States, that would increase the chance that China's growth this year will be the weakest in a quarter of a century.  \"We expect to see two more interest rate cuts this year and larger fiscal spending for the economy, but this will not change the fundamental path of slower growth,\" said Xiaojia Zhi, China economist at BofA Merrill Lynch.

It owes 80 percent of that debt to official lenders after private bondholders took a hefty writedown in 2012. Since outright debt forgiveness is politically impossible, the next best solution would be for Greece to pay off its expensive IMF loans early, redeem bonds held by the European Central Bank and extend the maturity of loans from euro zone governments to secure lower interest rates for years to come.\"This step would save Greece's budget billions of euros, while reforming the Troika arrangement, eliminating the IMF's and the ECB's financial exposure to Greece,\" said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, who advocates such an arrangement.It would lower the effective interest rate on Greek debt to less than 2 percent, far less than Athens was paying before the euro zone debt crisis began in 2009, and radically reduce the principal amount to be repaid over the next decade, giving Greece fiscal breathing space to revive its economy.And unlike ideas floated by Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis to swap euro zone loans for GDP-linked bonds and ECB holdings with perpetual bonds, paying out the IMF and the ECB early would be legal and supported by precedent. But if the economics make sense for Greece, the politics no longer add up for its partners.A euro zone official said there had been exploratory talks with the previous conservative-led Greek government about such a plan last year, before then Prime Minister Antonis Samaras chose to bring forward an election he lost rather than complete a bitterly unpopular bailout program.\"Now it's a political non-starter,\" said a euro zone official. \"There's just no appetite in the euro zone for a grand bargain to take over Greece's debt to the IMF and the ECB.\"LEVERAGETsipras' denunciations of EU-prescribed austerity, demands for German war reparations and cosying up to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Varoufakis' foot-dragging on reform negotiations and initial calls for a \"haircut\" on Greek debt, have dried up the reservoir of sympathy for Athens. Creditors like Germany, the Netherlands and Finland are bent on keeping the IMF involved as an enforcer of economic reform and fiscal discipline because they don't trust the Greeks to keep their word, nor the European Commission to hold them to it.\"They would prefer to provide debt relief on an annual basis so they keep leverage on Greece to stick to the program,\" said Miranda Xafa, senior scholar at the Centre for International Governance Innovation and a consultant on Greek debt.True, euro zone peers Ireland and Portugal, which received international bailouts after Greece, won EU agreement to pay off their costlier IMF loans faster, raising hopes in Athens.But Dublin and Lisbon were able to do so by borrowing more cheaply from private lenders after completing their bailout programs and regaining access to the capital markets.\"Ireland and Portugal are governments in difficulty, but they are not difficult governments,\" said Elena Daly, principal at EM Conseil, a Paris-based sovereign debt management adviser. Since Greece is stalling on its program and lacks market access, the only way it could pay off 24 billion euros owed to the IMF and redeem 27 billion euros of bonds held by the ECB would be for the euro zone's rescue fund to lend it the money.That in turn would require euro zone governments to convince their parliaments to risk more taxpayers' money than the roughly 170 billion euros they have already lent Greece in two bailouts totalling 240 billion euros.Many economists and euro zone officials believe Athens will anyway need a third bailout of around 30 billion euros this year, even though Tsipras insists Athens does not want that.Euro zone finance ministers promised in 2012 to \"consider further measures and assistance\" to ease Greece's debt provided it stuck to the terms of its program, which it has not done.Both Xafa and Daly said Tsipras had put himself in a near impossible position by making election promises incompatible with keeping the confidence of Greece's creditors.He needs to change the politics fast to have a chance of fixing the economics without resorting to capital controls, paying civil servants with IOUs or defaulting on foreign governments and being forced out of the euro zone, they argue.A referendum asking Greeks if they want to stay in the euro at the price of painful economic reforms, or a quick coalition change to bring in pro-reform centrists, may be his best options, even if they split his Syriza party.Greece's official creditors meanwhile are torn between wanting to keep it in the euro zone to avoid the precedent of a country exiting, and fearing that if Tsipras manages to roll back austerity and secure debt relief, he could embolden like-minded political forces in Ireland, Portugal and Spain. \u00a0\"So they want Greece to prosper and stay in the euro while at the same time wanting the new administration to fall on its face and become an object lesson for other electorates who may be toying with the idea of rebellion,\" Daly said.

Winterkorn, who in his eight-year reign has overseen VW's transformation from a struggling German group saddled with high labor costs into one of the world's most successful automotive companies, will not run away from his job and feels emboldened by support from strong allies, two sources at Wolfsburg-based VW told Reuters on Saturday.A spokesman for Volkswagen declined to comment on the report. Piech's office in Salzburg, Austria, didn't return calls seeking comment.   Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung reported earlier on Saturday that Winterkorn would not allow himself to be edged out of VW, citing unnamed sources at the carmaker who referred to his successful track record as CEO.Under Winterkorn's watch, VW has expanded from eight to twelve brands, more than doubled the number of production plants to over 100 and boosted sales 64 percent to a record 10.1 million vehicles last year.The state of Lower Saxony, where VW is based and which owns a fifth of VW's voting shares, as well as the carmaker's labor leaders who represent half the 20 members on VW's supervisory board on Friday came out backing Winterkorn.Together they have majority control of the panel which appoints and dismisses executives. Important decisions such as the building and shuttering of plants need a two-thirds majority.    Still, VW's chairman has a track record of undermining his own executives. In a Wall St Journal interview published in March 2006, Piech, already chairman of the supervisory board at the time, said it was an \"open issue\" whether the contract of then-CEO Bernd Pischetsrieder would be extended because of opposition from labor representatives.In November 2006, VW announced that Pischetsrieder had agreed to resign, and in 2007 it installed Winterkorn, then a close ally of Piech and head of VW's Audi division.In 2009, Piech publicly damaged the reputation of Porsche CEO Wendelin Wiedeking and chief financial officer Holger Haerter. Both executives quit within two months.

The government says it will also ultimately support bank lending to businesses, which has been shrinking for the past three years as Italy grappled with its longest post-war recession.Its most immediate effect will be to spur a long-delayed consolidation by making it easier for ownership of the so-called \"popolari\" banks to change, bankers say. They say the shake-up could also help find a buyer among the cooperative banks for troubled Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI) or Carige (CRGI.MI), the two Italian lenders that emerged as the weakest in the European checks.\"The measure has had the effect of an electric shock for the popolari,\" Piero Giarda, chairman of the supervisory board of Banca Popolare di Milano (PMII.MI), told a shareholder meeting on Saturday.  The bank is one of the 10 largest cooperative lenders affected by the reform, which was approved by parliament last month and scraps voting rules giving shareholders one vote each regardless of the size of their stake. The others are UBI (UBI.MI), Banco Popolare (BAPO.MI),  Popolare dell'Emilia Romagna (EMII.MI), Popolare di Vicenza, Veneto Banca, Popolare di Sondrio (BPSI.MI), Credito Valtellinese (PCVI.MI), Popolare di Bari, Popolare dell'Etruria e del Lazio (PEL.MI). Talks over possible tie-ups have already started, at least informally. \"We are talking to the cooperative bank world that has the same problems as us,\" Banco Popolare Chairman Carlo Fratta Pasini told shareholders.\"We're not looking to take over anyone, there are no predators and preys, we're just trying to find out whether there are traveling companions.\"Critics of the \"one-head, one-vote\" rule say it, together with ownership restrictions and limits on proxy voting, have distorted governance at the banks by allowing minority shareholders to block unwanted change. The rules have also long been seen as an obstacle to mergers and to attracting new investors. The expected wave of consolidation will help banks shoulder rising costs as regulators push lenders to increase their loss-absorbing capital, popolari executives say. Some also see domestic tie-ups as a defensive move against possible foreign takeovers. \"Looking for a partner, listed or not listed, is the most logical and safest solution for our future,\" said Gianni Zonin, chairman of unlisted Popolare di Vicenza. He said he hoped regional rival Veneto Banca \"accepts this invitation.\" Both lenders have hired investment banks to advise them on strategic options. They have also written down the value of their shares by 23 percent in an unusual move that is seen as smoothing the way for a possible tie-up.Monte dei Paschi, which is due to carry out a 3-billion euro rights issue to plug a capital shortfall laid bare by last year's review, said on Friday it had been told by the European Central Bank it also needs to find a merger partner. Bankers say UBI would be the most likely domestic candidate to take over the Tuscan bank.Another combination under consideration is between Popolare Milano and Banco Popolare, and possibly also with Popolare Emilia Romagna, according to a source close to the matter. The CEO of Banco Popolare has said Popolare Milano would be his ideal merger candidate. The Milan-based bank declined to comment.

GE stock jumped 8.5 percent.\"The stock has been under-owned by institutional investors, and that's going to change now,\" said Tom Donino, co-head of equity trading at First New York Securities.The repurchase program, which will be partly funded by $35 billion through money returned from GE Capital, is the second-biggest in history after Apple Inc's $90 billion plan. GE, which had 10.06 billion shares outstanding on Jan. 31, said it expected to reduce that by as much as 20 percent to 8 billion to 8.5 billion by 2018.\n        \n        In all, GE said it planned to shed $275 billion in GE Capital assets. That includes the previously announced spinoff of its Synchrony Financial credit card unit, the real estate transaction announced on Friday, and future sales of commercial lending and consumer banking businesses with assets of about $165 billion.The company plans to keep $90 billion in finance assets directly related to selling its products such as jet engines, medical equipment and power generation and electrical grid gear.GE has forecast earnings of $1.70 to $1.80 per share for this year, including 60 cents from GE Capital, but expects profit to be \u201csubstantially higher\u201d in 2018, executives said on a conference call with analysts. Shrinking GE Capital will reduce earnings by 25 cents per share, they said, but the stock buybacks should offset that impact.The company already had a significant number of inquiries about GE Capital units before Friday\u2019s announcement, said Keith Sherin, the finance unit's chief.\n        \n        Blackstone Group LP and Wells Fargo &amp; Co confirmed that they were buying most of the assets of GE Capital Real Estate for about $23 billion.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This is the biggest deal in the commercial property market since Blackstone's acquisition of office landlord Equity Office Properties Trust in 2007 for $39 billion, including debt.FOCUS ON INDUSTRIALThe moves announced on Friday will dramatically reduce GE\u2019s exposure to lending and other financial businesses.GE Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt told investors the company would try to generate 90 percent of its profits from industrial operations by 2018. He had previously forecast that share would grow to 75 percent by 2016 from 55 percent in 2013.\u201cWe just think the market timing is very good vis-a-vis the value of financial service assets,\u201d Immelt said in an interview. \u201cThere have been moments in the past when there weren\u2019t a lot of buyers. Now there are.\u201d Immelt and other GE executives said they planned to spend $3 billion to $5 billion a year on industrial acquisitions.GE said it could return up to $90 billion to investors through a combination of dividends, the $50 billion in share buybacks, and completion of the Synchrony spinoff planned for late this year.\tExecutives gave several reasons for GE's accelerated retreat from financial businesses. One is that since the financial crisis, it has become more difficult for GE to fund its lending operations.GE funded many of its loans and leases by borrowing money from bond markets. During the financial crisis it lost access to that funding, bringing it uncomfortably close to running out of cash. Lenders like GE Capital and CIT Group Inc, which cannot rely on bank deposits to fund their assets, have had to rethink the way they do business since the crisis. Many decided to either shed assets or become banks.GE Capital\u2019s size and the potential risks in its lending portfolio made it subject to government regulation as a systemically important financial institution. GE said it would apply to escape that oversight in 2016 as it reduces the financial business' size. GE said it would take after-tax charges of about $16 billion for the restructuring in the first quarter, of which about $12 billion would be non-cash.Shares of GE were sluggish for the past year despite previous moves to reposition itself around the industrial businesses. Still, Friday\u2019s more dramatic move away from finance caught some analysts by surprise.\"What we did not expect was the speed with which management would move to undertake this transformation,\" Sanford Bernstein analyst Steven Winoker wrote. \"We view today's announcement as an overwhelming positive for the company.\"During the conference call, Barclays analyst Scott Davis told executives that while he had been a critic, \u201cthis is good stuff ... I guess you can keep your jobs a little longer.\"JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co and Centerview Partners provided general financial advice to GE, while Bank of America Corp and Kimberlite Advisors advised on the real estate deal.

Firstly, most of the banks have already cut their deposit rates in select maturities over the last 4-5 months.\u00a0&#13;\n&#13;\n\t\"The cuts in deposit rates coupled with reasonable liquidity and lower wholesale funding rates has been leading to reduction in cost of funds and was reflected in better margins in December 2014 quarter and likely in March 2015 quarter as well,\" says Manish Karwa, research analyst at Deutsche Bank. He says that while margin impact of these cuts will be limited, any further rate cuts over the course of the year will impact NIMs for the banks.\u00a0&#13;\n&#13;\n\tAjay Srinivasan, Director, CRISIL Research, echoes this view. \"Lowering of base rate indicates the cost of funds for banks has declined, since base rate is calculated using deposit rates as the benchmark. Thus, decline in base rate would not impact net interest margins (NIMs).\"\u00a0&#13;\n&#13;\n\tOn the contrary, CRISIL Research expects NIMs to improve slightly in 2015-16, backed by a gradual economic recovery and improving proportion of retail loans, which have higher yields, he says.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tLast week, three large banks- SBI, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank cut their base rates by 15-25 basis points post RBI's monetary policy. Experts believe these cuts were long overdue given that RBI has already cut rates by 50 basis points in 2015 so far. While other banks could also trim their base rates, the impact of these cuts will be limited.\u00a0&#13;\n&#13;\n\tState Bank of India officials estimate about Rs 1,200-1,300 crore hit on interest income due to 15 basis point cut in base rate. Analysts believe SBI could witness a 4-5 basis points NIM impact while for ICICI Bank, the hit could be of about 5-6 basis points. In case of HDFC Bank, the impact will be negligible given that a relatively low (20%) proportion of its loan book is linked to the base rate. In case of ICICI Bank and SBI, this ratio stands at 50% and 80%, respectively. However, NIM movement is not contingent on just rates and is determined by other key factors such as credit costs as well.&#13;\n&#13;\n\t\t\t\tHOW THEY STACK UP&#13;\n\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0&#13;\n\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\tBank&#13;\n\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\tNIM (%)&#13;\n\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\tBase rate (%)&#13;\n\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\tSBI&#13;\n\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\t3.2&#13;\n\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\t9.85*&#13;\n\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\tPNB&#13;\n\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\t3.2&#13;\n\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\t10.25&#13;\n\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\tBoB&#13;\n\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\t2.2&#13;\n\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\t10.25&#13;\n\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\tICICI Bank&#13;\n\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\t3.5&#13;\n\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\t9.85*&#13;\n\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\tHDFC Bank&#13;\n\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\t4.4&#13;\n\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\t9.75*&#13;\n\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\tAxis Bank&#13;\n\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\t3.9&#13;\n\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\t9.95*&#13;\n\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\tNIM: Net interest margin as on 31st December, 2014&#13;\n\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0&#13;\n\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0&#13;\n\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\t*Revised base rates&#13;\n\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0&#13;\n\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0&#13;\n\t\t&#13;\n\tMeanwhile, for the quarter ending March 2015, Vaibhav Agrawal, VP Research \u2013 Banking, Angel Broking, says, \"We believe banks' NIMs should improve in the March 2015 quarter due to 3-4 basis points savings in cost of funds. Notably, March quarter would have the full impact of deposit rate cuts and hence may aid NIMs. However, higher credit costs on account of increased non-performing assets could offset these gains to some extent\", he says. \u00a0&#13;\n&#13;\n\tIDBI Bank executives, too, indicate that when clubbed with credit costs - amounts set aside for stressed loans - NIM impact will be more pronounced. Thus, public sector banks which have much higher credit costs as compared to their peers in the private sector will witness higher margin contraction. The actual impact though will vary from one bank to another.&#13;\n&#13;\n\t\"We believe bank-specific NIMs would vary quite meaningfully. Historical margin profiles show that the movement of bank-specific margins in an easing/tightening cycle are dependent on other factors as well, such as share of fixed rate loans, share of wholesale deposits and changing asset-liability profile\", analysts at Ambit Capital said in a recent report. They believe IndusInd Bank is best placed to protect its margins due to its high fixed rate portfolio, higher share of floating rate liabilities and improving liabilities.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tWhile most analysts believe the margin impact for banks will be limited, some have a contrarion view. Adarsh Parasrampuria of Nomura says, \"Given that banks have cut deposit rates by 25-50 basis points in the last 6-9 months, we would expect them to accelerate base rate cuts now. This will have a negative impact on bank margins, especially for PSUs, in the interim. We believe bank margins, especially for corporate/PSU banks, will be negatively impacted, due to faster transmission in a falling rate environment.

The move follows the Union Budget proposal to allow domestic fund managers to also manage offshore funds without adverse tax implications.According to sources, brokerages Edelweiss, Karvy, Centrum and IndiaNivesh are looking to start offshore funds, domiciled abroad but managed by their PMS fund mangers. Some have already approached the market regulator, Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), for a go-ahead.Earlier, domestic fund managers managing offshore money were construed as \"permanent establishment\" and thereby exposed them to additional tax liability. As a result, many operated from abroad, though they managed India investments from there.\"We have filed with Sebi. We are confident that whatever the issues on the tax front will be resolved. The demand from foreign investors to invest into Indian equities is tremendous. We are getting queries from places as far as Europe at this point,\" said Sandeep Jain, director, IndiaNivesh.Sector officials said there was a sharp increase in demand from investors in offshore jurisdictions, including Hong Kong and Singapore, to invest in Indian offerings. \"At this point, very established players are looking to launch offshore funds,\" said Swapnil Pawar, chief investment officer, Karvy Capital.Offshore funds and managers of these funds are required to fulfill certain requirements, specified in the current Finance Bill. These funds have to maintain a monthly average corpus of Rs 100 crore. The participation of Indians in such funds should not exceed five per cent of the corpus. There should be a minimum of 25 investors in each fund.\"The challenge for such funds would be the eligibility requirement, for funds and their managers. There is also some ambiguity on tax-related issues,\" said Pranay Bhatia, partner-direct tax, BDO India.Domestically, PMS providers need to have a minimum net worth of Rs 2 crore. They mainly cater to wealthy clients and must have a minimum size of Rs 25 lakh.Experts said starting of offshore funds would be an easy extension of the existing business for PMS providers. More entities are awaiting further clarity on the tax front before taking a decision. Clarifications from the Central Bureau of Direct Taxes are expected soon, they say.The interest generated by the Indian market among investors abroad in the past year has created interest among PMS providers on tapping this relatively unexposed business opportunity.\"The present taxation structure has an inbuilt incentive for fund managers to operate from offshore locations. To encourage such offshore fund managers to relocate to India, I propose to modify the permanent establishment (PE) norms to the effect that mere presence of a fund manager in India would not constitute PE of the offshore funds, resulting in adverse tax consequences,\" Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said in his Budget speech on February 28.Sectoral officials also said in cases where PMS providers already have offshore funds, many fund managers have started returning to India.

Experts believe there are many positive steps in the offing after the already announced measures.The Street believes credit default swaps (CDS) could be relaunched, steps to enhance liquidity in corporate bonds might be announced and a full-fledged and screen-based trading system for corporate bonds could be put in place.In the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) bi-monthly monetary policy review last week, it had spoken of\u00a0 formulating a scheme for market making by primary dealers in semi-liquid and illiquid government securities. \"A similar step could perhaps be taken by asking merchant bankers in corporate bonds to provide liquidity. Today, once the bonds get sold, these merchant bankers no longer provide liquidity to the market,\" said R Sivakumar, head of fixed income and products, Axis Mutual Fund.RBI also announced steps to boost retail participation in government securities. These include a web-based solution for all mid-segment and retail investors who have gilt accounts to participate in the G-Sec market, and providing them direct access to both primary and secondary market platforms without any intermediary. For this, alternate channels of distribution in G-sec would be created, RBI said.\u201cRetail participation in G-secs will take a long time, as fixed deposit rates are more attractive. There is scope for reforms in the corporate bond market. For instance, it is critical to have a full-fledged screen-based trading system for bonds,\" said S Prabhu, head of fixed income at IDBI Federal Life Insurance.Currently, secondary market activity in corporate bonds is negligible when compared with G-sec volumes. Besides, though CDS made its debut in 2011, the instruments failed to take off. CDS are instruments where the buyer receives credit protection, while the seller of the swap guarantees the creditworthiness of the security.\u201cThe CDS market is needed because those who invest in corporate bonds are exposed to interest rate and credit risks. We might also see reissue of bonds by companies, so that there is more liquidity in the market,\u201d said K P Jeewan, head of fixed income, Karvy Stock Broking.According to Nirakar Pradhan, chief investment officer of Future Generali India Life Insurance, the corporate bond market also needs a more transparent settlement mechanism.", "newspaper": "Business Standard", "id": 586, "pubdate": "Mon, 13 Apr 2015 00:25:00 +0530", "title": "More reforms likely for debt market in FY16"}, {"content": "&#13;\n         &#13;\n    &#13;\nIn a major relief to investors, the rollover of mutual fund fixed maturity plans (FMPs) beyond 36 months will not attract capital gains.

Lower crushing will lead to higher import of soy oil. Import of soy oil have, in fact, grown steadily over the years and touched 1.95 million tonnes in 2014-15.Soymeal exports are usually robust during October-February. They start declining after this period, when importers (our foreign customers) shift to other origins like South America, which begins harvesting a new soybean crop. With production rising and demand falling year-on-year, soybean stocks at the end of 2014-15 are expected to be higher if the demand doesn't see any pick-up.With the Indian soymeal season drawing to an end on a drastically poor note and world supplies set to rise in the coming days, Indian soymeal is set to face severe headwinds.If we take a look at the palm oil scenario, the production cycle in Malaysia is likely to turn to a high-yielding phase from March, recovering from the setbacks of weather anomalies, which will add to the supply side. If the weather remains conducive through the year, we could see production estimates revised higher. Production for 2015 is expected to be 20.5 mt, up from 20.2 mt in 2014. Also, one must watch out for crude oil prices and implementation of the bio-diesel mandate. If crude oil prices continue to remain under pressure, it would eventually make production of bio-diesel unviable. This would be mean further addition to the surplus palm oil available for consumption.After a sharp fall in crude oil prices, we have seen a drop in bio-diesel production. But if crude oil bottoms out, which looks likely, and gradually moves up, it will lead to an uptick in demand from bio-diesel sector.We will see arrivals of soybean from the world's two largest producing countries in full swing. This would mean higher crushing and, thereby, higher soy oil production.In India, we would also witness higher arrivals of rabi oilseeds from mid-March, likely to add to domestic vegetable oil supplies.According to the latest data, India's vegetable oil stockpiles stand above two mt, a level not seen at this point of time over the past few years. Therefore, higher supply of oils will dominate the market in 2015. However, prices of edible oils, which have remained under pressure, seem to have discounted the glut.The focus will be on sowing in the US and India. Any delay or drop in sowing can support prices. Pick up in Chinese demand and gradual increase in crude oil prices can also trigger an uptick in edible oil prices.&#13;\n\tThe author is head of commodities research, Nirmal Bang", "newspaper": "Business Standard", "id": 588, "pubdate": "Mon, 13 Apr 2015 00:18:00 +0530", "title": "Edible oils outlook: Is the worst over for the sector?"}, {"content": "&#13;\n         &#13;\n    Most retail investors failed to get any allotment in the Rural Electrification Corp (REC) offer for sale (OFS) conducted last week.

Married couples and civil partners can pass the allowance on to each other.If the Conservatives win the general election, then from April 2017 parents would each be offered a further \u00a3175,000 \"family home allowance\" to enable them to pass property on to children tax-free after their death.This could be added to the existing \u00a3325,000 inheritance tax threshold, bringing the total transferable tax-free allowance from both parents in a married couple or civil partnership to \u00a31m.The full amount would be transferable even if one spouse had died before the policy came into effect, the Conservatives say, and so would benefit existing widows and widowers.For properties worth more than \u00a32m, the new allowance would be gradually reduced so that those with homes worth more than \u00a32.35m would not benefit at all.Analysis, by Carole Walker, Conservative campaign correspondentDavid Cameron will be hoping his pledge to take the family home out of inheritance tax will galvanise his campaign in a week which will be critical for his prospects of staying in power.When George Osborne promised to raise the inheritance tax threshold to \u00a31m back in 2007, he delivered a huge boost to Tory morale and put Gordon Brown off holding a snap election. Subsequent promises to take more people out of the tax have not been delivered.  The threshold has been frozen since 2009 and rising property prices have dragged tens of thousands more families into the inheritance tax net. His opponents are already questioning whether voters will believe this latest promise. The announcement is likely to appeal to middle-class voters, particularly in London and the South East. But it also opens the Conservatives to the charge they are helping the wealthy.  David Cameron's team deny this - pointing out that it will be paid for by reducing pension tax relief for high earners and that many ordinary families now have to pay the tax.It is, however, a marked contrast to the promises from Labour and the Liberal Democrats to impose a \"mansion tax\" on expensive properties. Mr Osborne told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: \"Conservatives support the basic human instinct to provide for your children. And we believe that your home that you've worked for and you've saved for should belong to you and your family, not the tax man.\"So we will take family homes out of inheritance tax, we will effectively increase the inheritance tax threshold to \u00a31m, so that only millionaires pay inheritance tax.\"It was a message repeated in a speech by Mr Cameron, who said: \"You should be able to pass it (your home) onto your children. And with the Conservatives, the tax man will not get his hands on it.\"But shadow treasury secretary Chris Leslie, for Labour, said the policy was the latest \"panicky promise\" from the Conservatives. He said: \"The Tories made a promise on inheritance tax before the last election and they broke it. \"At a time when our NHS is in crisis and most working people are paying more under the Tories, it cannot be a priority to spend \u00a31bn on a policy which the Treasury says would not apply to 90% of estates.\"Danny Alexander said: \"It is extraordinary that the Tories will go into great detail on a policy that will cut tax for a small number of estates, but steadfastly refuse to give any detail at all on the massive cuts to public services that they desire.\"However, when asked whether the Lib Dems would block the proposals if they ended up back in coalition, he declined to say he would, instead saying: \"I'm saying I strongly disagree with it. Our priority... is further increases in the income tax personal allowance... we've stopped things in this parliament including cuts to inheritance tax for millionaires.\"", "newspaper": "BBC", "id": 603, "pubdate": "Mon, 13 Apr 2015 00:23:36 +0530", "title": "Inheritance tax plan 'about values'"}, {"content": "Supermarket workers paid the national minimum wage are forced to claim state benefits totalling \u00a311bn a year, according to a charity.Citizens UK said the employers of five million workers in the UK were being \"subsidised\" by the taxpayer.The minimum wage is \u00a36.50 an hour for people over 21, while the living wage calculated by the Living Wage Foundation is \u00a37.85 (\u00a39.15 in London).The British Retail Consortium said most supermarkets paid above minimum wage.When all extra earnings were considered, hourly pay was around \u00a38.40, it added.According to Citizens UK, which organises community campaigns, most of those earning less than the living wage are employed in the retail sector.

However, commodity prices were weighing on shares of some mining companies as iron prices remain depressed. Australia has said it expected the plunging price of iron ore to slash revenue forecasts by A$25bn (\u00a313bn; $19bn) over the next four years.Australian Treasurer Joe Hockey told the Australian Financial Review that the price for iron ore, Australia's biggest export, could fall as low as $35 a tonne. Shares of mining giant BHP Billiton were down 0.66% in early trade, while trading in Atlas Iron shares was suspended after the company said on Friday that it would stop all mining in Australia because iron ore prices were below its breakeven level.\"Despite an extensive cost-cutting program ... the global supply-demand imbalance for iron ore has driven prices down to the point where it is no longer viable for Atlas to continue production,\" the firm said.In South Korea, the Kospi was up 0.25% at 2,093.06.In China, the Shanghai Composite benchmark was up 0.86% at 4,069.17 points in early trade after crossing the 4,000 mark for the first time since 2008 on Friday.In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index added 0.35% to 27,367.66 points after marking a seven-year high last week. \n    ", "newspaper": "BBC", "id": 606, "pubdate": "Mon, 13 Apr 2015 07:26:48 +0530", "title": "Shares in Asia mostly up on Monday"}, {"content": "\n                        Rules to cap interchange fees were agreed in the European Parliament\n                    \n                Capital One, one of the biggest providers of cashback credit cards, is cutting the rewards it offers on its products.It blames a ruling in the European Parliament to cap so-called \"interchange fees\". These fees are paid by retailers to card issuers when a debit or credit card is used as payment. The European Commission claims that the fees are costing retailers across the eurozone \u20ac9bn (\u00a36.5bn) a year.It has described them as a \"direct attack on the single market\" and that they may be as high as 1.5% on every transaction made by consumers. They have traditionally been higher in countries like Poland and Lithuania, where credit cards are less commonly used.The new rules, which are due to pass into law later this month, would cap interchange fees at 0.2% for debit and 0.3% for credit transactions.The ruling follows a decade-long legal battle between Brussels and the card provider Mastercard. Lost revenueCritics claim that as well as being opaque, interchange fees can act as a bar to the introduction of new payment technology, such as fingerprint based payment systems or contactless mobile phone payments, and reform is needed at a time when alternative payment platforms like Paypal and Apple Pay are eating into market share. However, the new caps have raised concerns that credit card firms may seek to recoup lost revenue elsewhere. Capital One has written to its customers informing them that it is either cutting cashback points on its cards or axing them completely from 1 June.In a statement it said that \"following the European Parliament's resolution... the implications of significantly lower interchange revenue has meant... several (products) are no longer sustainable under current market conditions\".  It added that the changes will affect both existing and new customers. Greg Welch has had his Capital One \"Aspire World\" credit card, paying 1% cashback, for five years. He admits he uses it for almost everything, \"even buying a coffee in Costa, or petrol, paying for a hotel or flights, groceries... anything that I am going to spend over \u00a35 on.\"Fraud protectionThe card had been yielding Mr Welch an annual bonus of around \u00a3500, but he has now been told his cashback rate is being cut to just 0.25%He told BBC Radio 5 live, \"the bonus coming in January was really timely after the Christmas period. After being a loyal Capital One customer for years, I shall now try to source a better deal (elsewhere).\" The industry body, the UK Cards Association, had lobbied against the caps on fees, claiming \"they would upset the balance of cost-sharing between retailers and cardholders\".The association, whose members issue 55 million credit cards a year, has also warned that fee caps will mean less investment in fraud protection as well as fewer competitive offers for customers, indicating that other credit card rewards such as air miles or points on supermarket loyalty schemes may also be affected.  Capital One says has declined to say which of its cards, or how many customers overall, would be affected by the changes. But, it says that instead, the annual fees on cashback cards which range from between \u00a318 and \u00a3120, are to be scrapped or refunded to customers who have already paid them. \n    ", "newspaper": "BBC", "id": 607, "pubdate": "Sat, 11 Apr 2015 13:36:41 +0530", "title": "Capital One cuts cashback deals"}, {"content": "There are calls for the US and Canada to put a woman on a banknote. A similar campaign in the UK successfully convinced the Bank of England to put Jane Austen on the \u00a310 note. But is just one woman per country enough?American bills have portraits of the country's Founding Fathers and former presidents. Chinese notes have Mao Zedong and Indian ones have Mahatma Gandhi, but none of them feature any women. Many other currencies also stick to men, sometimes including a token woman or two.Now there are calls for the US to put a female on the $20 bill. \"The United States needs to show the world that we, too, recognize and value the contributions of women,\" says Susan Ades Stone, executive director of the campaign group Women On 20s.\"Our money says something about us and what we represent as a society. So if we're all about gender equality and diversity and inclusion, let's walk the walk.\"The US currently has seven bills in circulation, all of which feature distinguished, deceased American statesmen.Women On 20s conducted an online poll and asked people to choose which of 15 historical female leaders they would most like to see on the note.The candidates included civil rights activist Rosa Parks, birth control pioneer Margaret Sanger, suffragette Susan B Anthony and Harriet Tubman who escaped slavery and went on to lead other slaves to freedom.More than 200,000 people voted in the first round, and the second round - set to last a few weeks - is currently underway. \n                        Eleanor Roosevelt, pictured during her time as a representative to the United Nations...\n                    \n                \n                        ... and Rosa Parks are both finalists in the Women On 20s online poll.\n                    \n                Once the final poll closes, the group will petition President Obama to replace Andrew Jackson with the chosen woman.Many wonder why Jackson - the seventh president of the US - hasn't been removed from the $20 bill already. He is especially unpopular with Native Americans due to his signing and enforcing the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which forced tribes off their land. Thousands of Native Americans died on the journey west - known as the Trail of Tears - from exposure, starvation and disease.His controversial legacy is one of the reasons why Women On 20s chose to target this particular bill for change.Meanwhile in Canada, more than 54,000 people have signed a petition to put a woman on a banknote there after the sole female to appear on the country's currency, Therese Casgrain, was replaced in 2011 by an icebreaker ship.\"When we open our wallets and see the faces of four male prime ministers and Queen Elizabeth, the subtle message is that Canadian women aren't worthy of being celebrated,\" says author and historian Merna Forster who started the Canadian campaign.   \"Sexist banknotes are unacceptable in a country that boasts of being a world leader in promoting gender equality\u2026 If women are equal to men in Canada, they should be equally represented on our banknotes.\"\nSweden. \"We thought it was very important to feature an equal number of men and womenSusanne Eberstein, Sweden's Riksbank\nA similar petition was launched in the UK in 2013 after it was announced that Winston Churchill would replace Elizabeth Fry - a social reformer and philanthropist - on the \u00a35 note. More than 36,000 people signed it and convinced the Bank of England to put the author Jane Austen on the \u00a310 note from 2017.In both the UK and Canada, the Queen's portrait is on many banknotes. But, critics say this doesn't count because she appears as a monarch rather than for her achievements. Plus, she will eventually be replaced by a male heir.Although the UK petition was a success, campaigners in all three countries - the US, Canada and the UK - have called for only one woman on a note. But is that enough? Should half of all portraits on currencies be of women, better reflecting the makeup of the population?That's what's happened in Sweden. \"We thought it was very important to feature an equal number of men and women,\" says Susanne Eberstein, the chairman of the General Council at the country's Riksbank. \"It was well in line with our aims. It was very natural.\"Women appear on three of the banknotes there, although one of those depicted is Mother Sweden. A new line of Swedish notes, to be introduced in 2015 and 2016, will feature three men and three women - actress Greta Garbo, Pippi Longstocking author Astrid Lindgren, and opera singer Birgit Nilsson.Australia, too, has an equal number of men and women on its banknotes - each one has a male on one side and a woman on the other, apart from one with the Queen on it which has parliamentary buildings on the reverse.So why isn't Women On 20s petitioning for more than one woman to appear on American dollar bills?The organisation does believe there should be more women on notes but wanted to be realistic about its initial goal. \"We hope this is just the beginning,\" says Stone.But if bills should equally represent men and women, shouldn't they also reflect a nation's racial diversity? Again, this isn't usually the case, although there are exceptions. Australia, for example, has five bills in circulation, one of which features David Unaipon, an Aboriginal man. Unaipon was a pioneer for Aboriginal rights as well as a distinguished inventor and writer.Every US note features a white man, albeit one of the country's presidents or Founding Fathers, even though the US population comprises many races - notably, 13% are black and 17% Hispanic. The US Census Bureau lists seven different races, although Americans no doubt identify with many more ethnic backgrounds.  When the Women On 20s selection committee compiled their list of female candidates, they were conscious of diversity, but they did not set out to fill any particular quota, Stone says. Instead, they focused on the candidates' overall impact and trusted that a diverse group would result from the selection process. It did. The 15 female candidates include African, Asian and Native Americans as well as Caucasians.\n                        Another finalist in the vote - Wilma Mankiller, first female principal chief of the Cherokee Nation\n                    \n                \"I feel that the money that we have now is very last century,\" says Stone, adding that the US has changed enormously.\"We're more diverse. We're more inclusive. And the money should reflect that.\" However, \"It would be unrealistic to imagine that we could have a female representative of every ethnic group on the bills,\" she says. \"That's for another campaign.\"Perhaps a country can't fully represent the diversity of its population on a handful of notes. Euro bills - tasked with representing a huge span of people, cultures and history - depict stylised images of windows, doorways and bridges. Not even actual monuments, let alone portraits of real people.So could this be the solution - no portraits at all?Norway currently has women on two of its five banknotes. \"In a society where gender equality is an important value, having both male and female portraits on the banknotes is a matter of course,\" says Hilde Singsaas, from Norges Bank.However, Norway will soon be getting rid of both men and women when it introduces a new series of notes which will have a sea theme. The specific designs are not yet finalised but proposed motifs (below) feature ships, water and fish. This wasn't because of difficulty reflecting the diversity of Norway's population through portraits though, Singsaas says.\"All the previous banknote series featured portraits as the primary motif, without any clear connection between them,\" she explains. \"This time, the aim was to find a recurrent theme binding the banknotes together into a coherent whole.\"Similarly, Denmark recently introduced a new series of notes featuring bridges and prehistoric objects rather than people. Its previous series of five bills had women on two, men on two and one with a woman and a man. On its website, the Danish National Bank explains that the bridges symbolise links between various parts of Denmark and between the past and present.Putting bridges instead of people on the notes did not have anything to do with difficulty depicting a diverse population, says the bank's spokesman Lars Luth Mikkelsen.Another reason it might be easier to choose landscapes or buildings over people is that prominent figures are often controversial in one way or another, like Jackson in the US.Every person that you put on a banknote will garner some negative and some positive feedback, says Sweden's Eberstein. She and the Riksbank received criticism about the decision to put opera singer Birgit Nilsson on one of Sweden's new notes. Nilsson is pictured singing an opera by Richard Wagner, whose works are sometimes associated with Nazi Germany.Eberstein pointed out that Nilsson most often performed Wagner, who is still very popular today.\"She was a world famous singer,\" Eberstein says, \"and a good representative of Sweden at that time.\"And Women On 20s' Stone admits, \"You can never please everyone.\"Subscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox.\n    ", "newspaper": "BBC", "id": 608, "pubdate": "Mon, 13 Apr 2015 04:58:42 +0530", "title": "Which country has the least sexist banknotes?"}, {"content": "", "newspaper": "BBC", "id": 609, "pubdate": "Mon, 13 Apr 2015 04:50:13 +0530", "title": "VIDEO: A taste for kiwifruit in India"}, {"content": "Billionaire Mike Ashley's Sports Direct International has been challenged in Parliament about how the firm is run.Mr Ashley has been criticised before for the grip he has as a majority shareholder, on the firm - famous for top trainers on the cheap and indestructible oversized mugs. The Institute of Directors says it has warned already that Mr Ashley holds too much sway and the IoD's senior advisor on corporate governance, Oliver Parry says that there is no \"effective check on [Mr Ashley's] power\". Now his firm's handling of the collapse of one of its businesses, fashion chain USC, is also under scrutiny, being described at the Scottish Affairs Committee as \"well dodgy\".When approached by the BBC, a spokesman for Sports Direct declined to comment.USC, which sells clothing aimed at the younger market, ran into trouble last year after a row with a supplier. The company was losing \u00a320m a year and collapsed into administration in January, with the loss of 83 jobs at the USC distribution depot in South Ayrshire, provoking some indignation in Scotland. When the Scottish affairs committee met last month it was determined to find out more. Members were told, though, that Mr Ashley simply wasn't available to answer parliamentarians' questions at any point during the month of March.  Mr Ashley's legal representatives then took exception to the committee's habit of publishing correspondence, citing \"concerns over confidentiality\" and going as far as to invoke the European Convention on Human Rights.Keith Hellawell, the company's chairman, was sent in Mr Ashley's place. But he told the committee he and the board hadn't known anything about the collapse of USC until the day before it folded. But, he said, chief executive Dave Forsey had begun \"consulting\" with administrators Duff and Phelps as early as 14 November. Dr Hellawell insisted the firm \"didn't want\" USC to fold.'Well dodgy'Perhaps even more controversially USC hasn't shut up shop. Almost immediately after it went into administration the fashion retailer was bought by another part of Mr Ashley's business empire, through a so-called pre-pack administration, and is trading again. But with less debt, according to MPs. Conservative MP Simon Reevell told the Scottish affairs committee: \"Sports Direct had a company that was losing money, they now have the same company where the debt liability that had been incurred has gone.\"\"At one level, to use a technical phrase, this all looks well dodgy,\" he added.\n                        Mr Ashley built up his retailing empire after leaving school\n                    \n                Committee chairman Ian Davidson lamented how the process left the taxpayer \"done over\" in having to meet redundancy costs and unpaid taxes.  Dr Hellawell countered that by saying the company had paid more than \u00a31.3bn in tax to date.Board authorityThis latest controversy builds on earlier concerns.The IoD previously criticised a \u00a3200m payment to employees, including Mr Ashley. The company didn't disclose his share of the award. But \"we expect as a majority shareholder he got the majority of that,\" said Mr Parry.Paying a dividend, which would have been shared among all shareholders, may have been more appropriate, said Mr Parry. There are even more questions swirling around the collapse of USC.\"Could they have done something about it? And could they not have told shareholders and staff?\"If there had been a failure to inform the board sooner, this would suggest a lack of respect for the board's authority, he said.Workers were given even less notice, 15 minutes, before they heard they'd lost their jobs, the committee was told.Fatter marginsTo be sure, Mr Ashley has built a very clever business model. As well as owning stores, Sports Direct owns rights to popular brands such as Slazenger, Dunlop and Lonsdale. Good margins on these products mean he can afford to sell big brand products from the likes of Nike and Adidas at a greater discount than competitors, luring in shoppers.\n                        The company's success has made Mr Ashley a billionaire - he now owns Newcastle United Football Club\n                    \n                So when a customer pops in for a pair of Nike trainers, they can also be tempted to buy a Slazenger T-shirt or a pair of Lonsdale shorts with a fatter margin for Mr Ashley.Short leases on its stores mean it can be more flexible with demand, quickly shutting up shop and moving elsewhere if sales drop.It's a formula that has brought riches to shareholders in the long run. Those who bought shares in 2007 for \u00a33 apiece when Mr Ashley floated his firm would have more than doubled their money today. Luckier punters could have snapped up shares for as little as 32p in the crisis in 2008 and sold them last year for more than \u00a38. The firm has also been criticised for its zealous use of zero hours contracts, which don't guarantee regular work. Mr Hellawell told MPs that 4,300 of the firm's 19,000 staff were permanent. The rest of its workers are employed on zero-hours contracts.In terms of what must be done at Sports Direct, the IoD's Mr Parry said: \"It's hard to be prescriptive, but power lies with shareholders\" who must voice concerns at the firm's annual meeting on 10 September.Investors, employees and customers alike can watch Mr. Ashley to see whether this time he'd like to defend himself against these new allegations \n    ", "newspaper": "BBC", "id": 610, "pubdate": "Mon, 13 Apr 2015 04:40:29 +0530", "title": "Sports Direct 'needs power check'"}, {"content": "For an architect well known for his attention to detail, smart phones are a godsend for Soo Chan.The Singapore-based 53-year-old uses an app on his mobile phone to keep a close eye on his various projects around the world, such as a new luxury apartment building in New York.\"When I'm in Singapore there's a 12-hour time difference [with New York], so before I go to bed at night, I check on it through this app,\" says Mr Chan.The app connects to video cameras, which give him a real time view of construction work.He adds:  \"I can even zoom in and look closely at the welding.\"\nIn Asia there are three professions - lawyer, doctor and accountantSoo Chan\nThe founder and design director of Singapore-based SCDA Architects, Mr Chan has over the past 20 years built up a business that today employs more than 100 architects and designers.Its past projects around the world range from luxury hotel resorts in Bali and the Caribbean, the National Design Centre in Singapore, a shopping centre in Beijing, a government building in New Delhi, to private houses from France to Malaysia.It is quite an achievement for an architect who built the company without the need for outside investors, after starting out with just five members of staff.'Neo-tropical architecture'Born in Penang, Malaysia, before being raised in Singapore, Mr Chan says his first work as an architect was building things with Lego bricks as a small child.He also remembers from his young childhood that he was fascinated by watching his family's new home being constructed.\n                        His latest project is a luxury apartment building in New York with private swimming pools\n                    \n                Yet despite this early interest in architecture, his family had other hopes for him. \"In Asia there are three professions - lawyer, doctor and accountant,\" says Mr Chan.But determined to study architecture after leaving school, he travelled to the US where he did a degree in the subject at the prestigious Yale University in Connecticut.\n                        SCDA's buildings often feature courtyards\n                    \n                Mr Chan subsequently spent two years in New York, working for architectural firm Kohn Pederson Fox.The lure of home then saw him return to Singapore, where in 1995 he started SCDA Architects.Mixing both Asian and Western design, Mr Chan has developed his own style, which he calls \"neo-tropical architecture\", and which often aims to blur the lines between the inside and outside of a building, often utilising - in very simple terms - lots of courtyards.Mr Chan says that the practice has grown slowly but steadily over the years.While most staff are based at the headquarters in Singapore, some are located in Shanghai and New York.And despite his reputation for attention to detail, and regular visits to the other two offices, Mr Chan says he knows the importance of delegating.\"I focus on the bigger picture, and then come in and look selectively at the small, important details. I then find that the middle bit takes care of itself,\" he says.\n                        SCDA now employs more than 100 architects and designers\n                    \n                He adds that he relies on key employees to handle the day-to-day functioning of the company, confident that everyone at the firm speaks \"the same design language\".\"We share the same thinking about how you design and use space.\"'Big moment'Married, and with no less than six sons, Mr Chan's latest big development at work is the Soori High Line apartment building, which is currently being built in Manhattan, New York.He says it is a \"big moment\" for him, as it will be the first building he has built in the city where he began his working life as an architect.\n                        When not working, Mr Chan has a big family to look after\n                    \n                The luxury scheme has raised eyebrows in the Big Apple because 16 of the building's 31 apartments will have their own private, indoor swimming pools, something of a rarity in the city.\"The pools are definitely the highlight,\" says Mr Chan, who has already built apartment blocks in East Asia with private pools.\"It certainly evokes a reaction, you either like it, or you think it's a bit crazy. People think - it's a pool. Do I swim every day? How do I maintain it?\"But true luxury means never having to worry about all these practicalities.\"The risk is not in the making of it, but in culturally getting everyone - even my own salespeople and consultants - on board.\"The building is due to be finished in 2016, and Mr Chan is confident it will be a sell-out.

Is investing in these desert dwellings like playing on quicksand or has the city-state learnt the lessons of its 2008 property crash when it nearly went bust? The BBC's Mark Lobel investigates.There are countless reasons why people still buy in Dubai.It is the perfect tax haven for rich foreigners.Long-term resident and British developer Andrew Lemon says: \"Sun, fun, no tax still applies - and it's a big draw.\" He has noticed some people prefer it to Monaco to flee tax laws in France.Dubai is also a safe haven for regional investors in a stormy Middle East.Lebanese-born businesswoman Nejoud Nasr left Beirut for Jordan in 1975 when the civil war began. She feels Dubai is now the safest place in the region for a family, with the rest of the Middle East \"marked by a lot of political instability\".Blend of East and WestFor wealthy Asians, it is a close-by, comfortable, retirement village.For Indian former private banker Ranjita Balasubramaniam, Dubai ticks a lot of boxes.She likes its blend of East and West, wants to settle in the Emirates and employ domestic staff to help her at home.\"We have always had help around us. Dubai allows you the ability to have that,\" she said.A surge in house prices and sales since 2013 suggests confidence is returning to Dubai's real estate sector after its disastrous past.But what went wrong and has anything actually changed?Musical chairsWhen foreigners were permitted to buy in 2002, it helped turn the obscure fishing village into a global hub.Estate agents who watched the property boom over the next six years said it was like the Wild West because the regulations were so lax.Speculators made a fast buck by selling off-plan properties for a large profit within weeks of their initial investment - with no intention of ever living there.Linda Mahoney, one of Dubai's first Western estate agents, described it as a game of musical chairs.\"It went on and on and on and there was always another place to sit\u2026 In June 2008 the music stopped and the chair wasn't there.\"\n                        Investment apartments are large and can be sumptuously appointed\n                    \n                Once the global credit crisis of 2007 spread to Dubai a year later, lending dried up, many foreign investors left and confidence in the emirate's overinflated real estate market was shattered.It was a bloody period as property prices fell from between a third to under half of their previous value in months. The stock market fell 70% and thousands of mostly Asian labourers were sent back home.Huge housing projects were stalled or scrapped.Before the crash, investors piled into one large, well-located apartment block named after Hanover Square in the West End of London.The Dubai development is 15 minutes from a golf course and the sea and half an hour from the busiest international airport in the world.In 2007 investors put down tens of thousands of dollars but have so far received nothing.Its developer ACW Holdings said it is \"rapidly nearing completion\". When I visited the site it looked about 80% ready. It should have been completed six years ago.Others have been less lucky and lost everything on cancelled projects.Surreally craftedAnother effect of the financial crisis was the alarming exposure of Dubai's huge, outstanding debt at the time.To understand it, I took a boat trip around the iconic Palm Jumeirah to see the eye-watering multimillion dollar villas on the man-made island.They represent a life of poolside and yacht-filled luxury surreally crafted in the middle of the desert.Yet in 2008 the ambitious island project, along with two others also built by the government-owned developer Nakheel, nearly brought Dubai to the brink of defaulting on its debt because so much had been borrowed to make it happen.Only a $20bn lifeline from Dubai's oil-rich neighbour, Abu Dhabi, saved it from going bust.Half the money was used to bail out Nakheel, which brought in a new man to steer it to calmer waters.The Nakheel chairman Ali Rashid Lootah told me the company had a remaining $1.2bn of debt that he expects to clear by August next year.However, other state-related entities are holding $140bn worth of debt, according to the International Monetary Fund, which it believes is a worrying amount if another downturn occurs.But real-estate regulations have improved.UnpredictableThe government has discouraged speculators by doubling a transaction tax and there are rules to help investors seek compensation if a project is cancelled.The combination of the new rules and weaker economic conditions globally, which affect investment in Dubai as foreigners make up around 90% of its population, means the market is cooling. Property prices have dropped about 5% so far this year.Yet many in the industry do not rule out another bubble forming - as Dubai remains unpredictable.Sunil Jaiswal organised the first international property show dedicated to Dubai. He told me that the question he gets asked most in any show is whether the market will crash.\"Right now the market is quite stable in Dubai. We haven't seen excessive growth... Will the market crash? Of course it will. Maybe it's three months away.

Many money investors are calling a bottom in oil prices, as speculators in US crude oil futures and options raised net long positions by some 52 million barrels in the week to April 7, data from the  US Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed. That was the biggest one-week rise in bullish bets since 2011, according to CFTC data.

Even options volumes for $100 a barrel have increased by almost 20 percent this year. \"Speculative market participants appear to be calling for a bottom in oil prices,\" ANZ said in a note. While prices may not fall much further, the bank said that a big price rally also remained unlikely. \"Although there are tentative signs of demand improving and rig counts fell to the lowest level since 2010, an ongoing global market surplus - driven by swelling US inventories (the biggest weekly jump since March 2001) and Saudi Arabian output to record high levels - should limit any potential rally.\" Other analysts were even more cautious, warning that supply and demand fundamentals were deteriorating. \"Global oil fundamentals have been quite strong YTD (year-to-date), but we now see signs that physical markets are weakening. Global refining margins, while still healthy, have fallen materially. With US runs set to ramp over the coming weeks, global turnarounds rising and product demand weakening seasonally, we expect product builds and pressure on global refining margins, which should diminish the appetite for non US crudes,\"  Morgan Stanley said. The bank said that production from exporters like Libya, Saudi Arabia and  Russia as well as slowing demand for West African crude were also indicators of weak market fundamentals. \"All of these factors were a precursor to the price correction last summer,\" Morgan Stanley said, referring to the halving of oil prices since June last year as soaring output clashes with slowing demand.

The ECB's borrowing rates are all but certain to be held at record lows, but continued wrangling between Greece and the euro zone over reforms and aid is casting a cloud of uncertainty over the 19-country currency bloc. Athens has until the middle of this week to improve a package of reforms required for the release of euro zone loans that it needs to stay afloat. Were Greece ultimately to tumble out of the euro, it would deal a blow to the credibility of the currency union. Athens was first bailed out almost five years ago by the euro zone with another aid deal in 2012 but its future remains uncertain.\"The euro crisis is not over. But the currency union is in a sweet spot, with a lower euro and oil prices helping the economy,\" said UBS economist Martin Lueck. \"QE can help to repair the euro zone economy but it is too early yet to judge its chances.\"Draghi is likely to address the euro zone's improving prospects. The ECB's actions are creating fertile conditions for growth, with the euro at a 12-year low buoying exporters and borrowing in many countries cheaper than ever.Some investors hope he will also show there is room for flexibility in rolling out money printing to ensure the 60 billion euro ($63.29 billion) a month program stays on track.With recent data pointing to a economic turnaround, some financial market traders are already asking when and how the ECB might start scaling down its stimulus, although that is still a long way off for now.  \"The ECB can be quite happy about recent developments,\" Commerzbank economist Joerg Kraemer said, pointing to improving lending. \"But they will not want to rule out further steps, such as that the (QE) program goes beyond September 2016.\"Draghi will hold a press conference on Wednesday before he travels to Washington to join finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 20 top economies at the International Monetary Fund's Spring meeting.He may reveal whether the ECB's decision-making Governing Council extended the limit on emergency liquidity that can be drawn by Greek banks.

With that less of a threat, policymakers can now focus on charting an appropriate rate path and worry less about sliding back to zero, Williams said in an interview late on Friday, expressing a view that appears to have taken root more broadly at the central bank.\"As we go through time, that probability of saying 'well, the shocks are going to push us back,' seems to be less, seems to be decreasing,\" said Williams, who this year is one of 10 voting members of the Fed's policy panel and whose views are seen as closely aligned with Chair Janet Yellen. \"More importantly, we are really thinking about a path, we are talking about moving interest rates from zero to a normal level over several years,\" he said, echoing recent comments by several other Fed policymakers.\"So even if the economy got some bad shocks, really you are probably just talking about flattening that path out a bit, or maybe raising rates more slowly.\"  LIFT-OFF, DATA AND T-SHIRTSTo get that message across Williams has begun giving away T-shirts, printed at his own expense, showing an arrow busting upwards out of a computer and declaring: \"Monetary policy -- It's data dependent.\"The slogan captures a shift increasingly evident in the language of some of the Fed's most influential policymakers - away from concerns about acting \u201ctoo early\u201d toward a focus on calibrating rates in a way that will sustain steady recovery. In fact, the Fed now needs to weigh the risks of waiting too long before a rate lift-off, Williams said. The concern is a late start to rate increases could force the Fed to tighten policy more aggressively and potentially disruptively if stronger economic growth sparks inflation pressures.\"A little earlier and more gradual versus later and more aggressive: those are the options we have,\" Williams said. To be sure, some policymakers, notably the presidents of the Minneapolis and Chicago Fed banks, still argue that raising rates too soon poses a bigger risk than waiting too long. Economists last month pushed their expectations of a rate hike later into 2015 from mid-year after the Fed downgraded its economic outlook. However, recent policymaker comments suggest the Fed would be still poised to act if data over the next two months confirmed continued job growth and an expected rebound from the weak start to the year.In the last two weeks, three Fed governors have laid out the argument that it is the longer rate path, not the date of lift-off, that matters. Jerome Powell in New York last week made the direct case that the Fed should not wait to act until its goals of full employment and 2-percent inflation are in view.As the U.S economy nears full employment, there is less need to keep rates near zero for long to compensate for the central bank's inability to cut rates further in case of a shock, Williams said.He also said that regardless of the timing of the first hike, rates should stay below neutral to help the economy grow at a faster-than-normal pace. Such accommodative policy is necessary to further reduce  unemployment, which at 5.5 percent is still too high in his view, and push up inflation, which remains well below the Fed's 2-percent target. The San Francisco Fed chief expects the U.S. economy to reach full employment in six to twelve months, and forecasts a tighter labor market will start lifting wages and inflation more broadly. Comments from Fed officials and forecasts published in March suggest a majority of policymakers is prepared to raise rates either in June or during the June to September period, but Williams declined to be pinned down. \"June is a long ways off, we\u2019ll get more data before June,\" he said. \"I am not going to talk about June or September.

Of course, that wasn't the plan. Choices made by several oil majors that built more exposure to prices into their portfolio, mainly through the kinds of contracts they opted to sign, was aimed at enjoying prices that were historically high. \"In simple terms it (oil price sensitivity) has increased and that's been a deliberate choice,\" Simon Henry, Chief Financial Officer at Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Europe\u2019s largest oil group by market value, told Reuters.\"We took a view that prices were going to go up and that our portfolio was less exposed than it should be in that environment because of the types of contracts we had in place,\" he said.Shell made the decision in the early 2000s and it took around a decade for that to have a real impact on the company's bottom line, Henry said.  In 2009, Shell's then-CEO Peter Voser said a $1 move in the crude price would shift earnings up or down by around $200 million. In January, Henry estimated the impact of a dollar move on earnings was around $330 million and increasing.Brent crude averaged $54 per barrel in the first quarter of 2015 \u2013 half of what it was in the same period last year. If the current price holds, the hit to Shell's pre-tax earnings from the increased sensitivity alone could run to billions of dollars a year compared to what it would have been if the 2009 linkage between profits and oil prices had held steady.Filings from Europe's second and third largest oil groups, London-based BP and Paris-based Total, show a similar trend.In early 2013, London-based BP said a $1 change in the oil price would lead to a $250 million change in annual pre-tax replacement cost operating profit in its oil and gas production division. In March, the company said on its website that a $1 movement in Brent would change earnings by $300 million.Total said in 2013 that a $1 rise in Brent would lift adjusted net operating income by $140 million. Earlier this year, it said the impact would be $170 million. The increase in sensitivity is despite the fact that production levels \u2013 the main determinant of how much oil prices hit earnings \u2013 have fallen at all three companies.SLOW TURNAROUNDMany oil companies missed out on much of the benefit of the oil price surge from 2004 to 2008. Instead governments grabbed most of the gains, in part due to the contracts the companies had signed years earlier.Historically, companies bought exploration licenses and agreed that, if they struck oil, they would pay governments a royalty \u2013 often a share of output - even if no profit was declared.During the 1990s, when oil prices were low and profit margins tight, companies signed an increasing number of Production Sharing Agreements (PSAs), which offered returns based on the cash they invested. That meant companies had a better chance of getting their money back.But the safety came at a cost.\"You're protected on the downside, but you lose some of the upside,\" said Neill Morton, oil analyst with Investec.Morton said the contracts became less popular with investors as oil prices soared in the mid-2000s.Shell was one of the first companies to make the shift to projects with greater oil price sensitivity. It increased investments in OECD countries, which do not typically offer PSAs, and, where it did sign PSAs, it sought to link the returns to prices rather than accept a fixed return on money invested.Others followed its lead.\"It was a general trend. Companies were keen to capture the upside from oil prices,\" said Tom Ellacott, at consultants Wood Mackenzie.In February 2008, Philippe Boisseau, president for Gas &amp; Power at Total, told investors that his company was reducing the share of its production that came from production-sharing contracts that only offered a fixed return. In July 2008, BP's then-CFO Byron Grote told investors the group was accelerating its exploration program and looking for opportunities \"especially in our key tax and royalty areas, that allow us to capture price upside\".Total declined to comment on its current strategy in respect to oil price exposure. BP said the company didn't target a specific exposure but rather managed its portfolio over time to maximize returns and balanced investments between PSAs and tax and royalty regimes. BG Group, which last week agreed a $70 billion takeover by Shell, said its oil price sensitivity increased simply because the historically gas-focused company discovered a lot of oil.The world\u2019s largest oil company by market value, Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) has seen no change in its sensitivity to oil prices in recent years, while Chevron does not publish figures. Both declined comment.Ellacott said that while the strategy of gaining more exposure to oil prices may hurt today, oil projects had a long life and most oil companies remain optimistic about long term oil prices.Shell is unapologetic about its decisions. CFO Henry said the world's growing energy needs would support crude prices in the years to come.\"We still firmly believe that absence war, pestilence and famine, demand will continue to grow,\" Shell\u2019s Henry said.

A new supply chain would be created, generating high-quality jobs and bringing down prices of the coveted gadgets.Four years later, none of that has come true.Foxconn has created only a small fraction of the 100,000 jobs that the government projected, and most of the work is in low-skill assembly. There is little sign that it has catalyzed Brazil's technology sector or created much of a local supply chain.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The iPhones now rolling off an assembly line near S\u00e3o Paulo, the only ones in the world made outside China, carry a retail price tag of nearly $1,000 for a 32-gigabyte iPhone 5S without a  contract - among the highest prices in the world and about twice what they sell for in the U.S. That Brazil has so little to show for the Foxconn investment underscores the shortcomings of its industrial policy, defined by costly tax incentives that have driven a widening government budget deficit without spurring growth. The economy currently hovers close to recession and the productivity of Brazil's workforce is stagnant.Apple Inc\u2019s (AAPL.O) iPhone sales in Brazil have still been rising. Wholesale shipments increased more than 40 percent to 2.9 million last year, according to research firm Gartner.Apple declined to comment for this story. Representatives for the Brazilian government and Foxconn declined to comment on why the investment fell so far short of\u00a0initial projections.With wages rising quickly in China, home to most of its 1.3 million employees, Foxconn is trying to control costs by using more robotics and expanding its global footprint to make more electronics in markets where they are sold.But navigating politics and managing expectations beyond China has been tricky for Foxconn, whose flagship listed unit is Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (2317.TW).For instance, Indonesia's government has said for years that Foxconn would invest up to $10 billion, but plans remain in limbo due to political snags.In Brazil as in Indonesia, politicians and government officials were the ones making the big forecasts after conversations with Foxconn, which has been more circumspect in its own public statements and projections.CITY OF EXAGGERATIONSStill, as Foxconn ramped up assembly of iPhones and iPads in Brazil during 2012, reaping tax benefits, the company made a public commitment. The company pledged an initial investment of 1 billion reais ($325 million) to anchor an industrial park producing components locally within two years.The location: Itu, a sleepy tourist town in S\u00e3o Paulo state nicknamed \"The City of Exaggerations.\"Today the site remains an empty expanse of dirt, where bulldozers have been leveling the land since late last year.City councilor Givanildo Soares da Silva, who helped lead the push to donate nearly 100 acres of land to Foxconn, has since turned against the project.\"People are really frustrated,\" Silva said. \"We were expecting all these jobs by now and it's still just empty promises.\"The Itu mayor's office said in a statement it had given all the support necessary to bring Foxconn to the city, declining to comment on reasons for the delay.Foxconn said in a statement the facility should be operational by the end of this year, bringing its Brazilian workforce to more than 10,000, though it did not provide a specific number of jobs or disclose how many are working on Apple products.Apple's official list of its top 200 suppliers, accounting for 97 percent of materials and manufacturing costs, includes just two companies in Brazil: Foxconn and fellow Taiwanese electronics company Lite-On Technology Corp (2301.TW).Foxconn currently has five facilities in the country that make products under contract for various technology companies, including just one unit producing Apple devices in Jundia\u00ed, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) east of Itu.\"Foxconn continues to invest in our operations in Brazil,\" the company said in a statement. \"We are committed to our goal of introducing innovative technologies that enable our employees in Brazil to focus on high value-added elements.\"Workers interviewed outside the Jundia\u00ed plant said they had yet to see that skilled work.\"You hear 'Foxconn' and 'Apple' so you think it's something special. But there's no glamour in there. It's a dead-end job,\" said Andressa Silva, 19.Silva tests iPhones at the plant for about $80 a week, just $15 above the minimum wage. She and several colleagues complained of monotonous work and a lack of promotion opportunities.Evandro Oliveira Santos, the head of the local metalworkers' union, told Reuters the union was organizing for a strike at the factory. It would be the fourth in as many years.\u00a0The union wants better working conditions and professional development for the roughly 3,000 workers at the facility.Foxconn turned down a request to tour the plant, but said in a statement it worked to meet international workplace standards, cooperated with unions and listened to feedback from employees.ALL THE DANCINGWhen Terry Gou, the founder and chairman of Foxconn, discussed Brazilian labor in the past, his take was withering.\"Brazilian workers' wages are very high. But Brazilians, as soon as they hear 'soccer,' they stop working. And there's all the dancing. It's crazy,\" he told the Wall Street Journal in 2010. Those comments made few Brazilian friends for Gou, who deftly built a manufacturing empire in China, but the underlying complaint was familiar to business leaders here.Economists consider low productivity one of the chief reasons for the steep cost of consumer goods in Brazil, along with high tariffs and interest rates.Analysts who follow Foxconn say the company may have underestimated those challenges during talks in early 2011 with Brazilian officials.One of the clearest signs that the announcements in Beijing were premature came when a proposed deal for Foxconn to make touch screens in Brazil fell apart the next year.Foxconn pushed to make cheaper screens rather than use the latest screen technology, and the company was reluctant to commit its own capital, according to press reports at the time.\"There was a misunderstanding,\" said Maria Luisa Cravo, the head of investments at APEX, Brazil's federal agency promoting foreign trade and investment. \"Brazil expected one thing and Foxconn expected something else. But talks have restarted on this,\" she told Reuters.Officials at three Brazilian ministries involved in the project declined requests for interviews about Foxconn's investments.A spokeswoman at Brazil's science and technology ministry said\u00a0the tax breaks benefiting Foxconn require it to reinvest 4 percent of Brazilian revenue in research and development. Local content and assembly contribute at least 20 percent of the value of the devices that Foxconn makes in Brazil, she added.With that, an industrial sales tax of around 15 percent and a value-added tax of about 9 percent on imported iPhones and iPads are largely eliminated when the products are made in Brazil, tax experts said. In addition, locally made devices avoid heavy import duties, and a Sao Paulo state consumption tax would be less than half the 18 percent levied on foreign goods. Some companies have passed the lighter tax burden along to consumers.

In a sign that domestic demand was also tepid, imports into the world's second-biggest economy shrank 12.7 percent last month from a year ago, the General Administration of Customs said on Monday. By volume, coal imports plunged more than 40 percent in January-March.The March fall in imports was in line with forecasts, unlike the one for exports.\"It's a very bad number that was much worse than expectations,\" Louis Kuijs, an economist at RBS in Hong Kong, said about the export data.\"It leads to warning flags both on global demand and China's competitiveness.\"Buffeted by lukewarm foreign and domestic demand, China's trade sector has wobbled in the past year on the back of the country's cooling economy, unsettling policymakers.\n        \n        Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang was quoted by Xinhua state news agency as saying earlier this month that authorities must arrest China's export slowdown lest it further dampens economic growth.Wang was quoted as saying that local governments should offer \"preferential policy support\" and encourage more private investment in exports.Anaemic growth in the trade sector could hurt jobs, which the government wants to protect for fear that widespread unemployment could fuel social discontent and trigger unrest. So far, China's labor market appears to be holding up well, despite signs that economic growth is steadily grinding to its lowest in a quarter of a century of around 7 percent.Data on growth in the first quarter will be released on Wednesday.DIFFICULTIES FACEDLast month's trade performance left China with a surplus of $3.1 billion, much smaller than the poll forecast for a $45.4 billion trade gap.On a quarterly basis, exports appeared to fare better than imports. Export sales were up 4.7 percent in the first quarter compared with a year ago, improving from a 3.4 percent fall seen between January and March last year.Imports, on the other hand, crumbled 17.6 percent in the first three months from a year ago, reversing the 1.6 percent increase in 2014's first quarter.Yet analysts said a breakdown of the data showed exports in March were clearly crimped by a stronger yuan, which is pegged to a rising dollar.Indeed, Huang Songping, a spokesman at China's customs office, acknowledged the difficulties that exporters faced from a firmer yuan.Costs stemming from labor, financing and the exchange rate \"remain stubbornly high and the competitive advantage of the traditional foreign trade has been weakened,\" Huang said. He added that 56.2 percent of exporters surveyed by the government said their costs had risen in March.Against the euro EUR=, the yuan hit a record high of 0.15274 euros CNYEUR=R on March 16, up a steep 14 percent against the common currency this year.That helped to dent Chinese export sales to Europe. Shipments to the European Union had their biggest fall in more than a year, as did those to Japan.\"The really weak trade surplus has implications for the weakness in the renminbi,\" said Andrew Polk, an economist at the Conference Board in Beijing. \"So we might see more weakness going forward.\"China expanded grew its trade sector by 3.4 percent in 2014, according to government data, missing the government's growth target of 7.5 percent by more than half.Taking that disappointing outcome into account, the government has lowered its growth target for 2015 combined imports and exports to around 6 percent.

He added it would help test recipes to be used at Yum's China outlets.For Yum, a China turnaround is vital. New CEO Greg Creed said last month that reviving sales in the country was \"priority number one, two, and three\".\"This new development shows someone has advised them that they've got to try something different,\" said Michael Griffiths, Shanghai-based analyst with market research firm TNS.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With its fancy crystal, high prices and murals influenced by 16th century Italian painters, Atto Primo's ties to Yum are almost invisible: its only link to Yum is a brief mention in a U.S. regulatory filing.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BRAND FATIGUE\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The high-end diner isn't the only new strategy for Yum in China, where it is planning to build 700 new fast-food stores overall this year. CEO Creed said the firm aimed to rival Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) with more coffee offerings in China.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, analysts say Yum is suffering \"brand fatigue\" in the country. Its image has been hurt by the food scares, which raised doubts over its supply chain, and competition is rising.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tang Yenan, a 29-year-old architect in Shanghai, said he used to eat often at KFC about 15 years ago when it seemed \"fancy and new\" and was seen as a safe and clean alternative to local options.\"Now I don't have KFC so often, because I have so many other choices,\" he said.McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) has also been stung in China by food scares, but moves to upgrade stores and roll out its McCafe concept have helped offset the damage, analysts said.Nonetheless, both brands have lost some ground as more nimble local rivals have tempted cost-conscious diners with healthier-sounding, homegrown fare.Online chatter about the two brands \u2013 both good and bad - has stalled on China's influential Sina Weibo. Such a trend would normally cause some concern among marketers that brands are struggling to stay totally relevant to younger audiences.Yum has seen its share of China's nearly 800 billion yuan ($129 billion) fast-food market fall over the last few years, according to market research firm Euromonitor.

Shadow Chancellor Mr Balls explained that a Labour government would have to make cuts in \"non-protected\" areas which would apply in England and Scotland.He went on to say that changes to the tax system, such as the proposed \"mansion tax\" rule, would mean Labour could increase spending in priority areas such as the NHS.Mr Balls said he believed that in 2015/16 that would deliver \u00a3800m extra for Scotland which could then be spent on jobs for young people, more childcare and the NHS.He added: \"Whether or not the overall Scottish budget is cut depends upon whether or not that \u00a3800m, which is financed and extra, is more than or less than our unplanned cuts - and that will depend upon the scale of the unplanned cuts.\"I can't say to Scotland that you're going to be exempt from spending cuts in the unprotected areas but they're sensible and they are absolutely in marked contrast to what the Tories are proposing - because they want to have double the spending cuts next year than last year - and also the SNP, because what we exposed last week is the SNP both won't match our manifesto pledges but also their fiscal autonomy within the UK is actually fiscal austerity in the UK.\"It would mean a massive cut to spending in Scotland.\"Following the radio interview, Mr Murphy said he and Mr Balls had been clear that a Labour government would \"have to make savings\" north and south of the border, however, he suggested these need not continue beyond 2015/16.ANALYSISBy Brian Taylor, BBC Scotland political editor\n                        United front in Edinburgh last week - Jim Murphy, Ed Miliband and Ed Balls\n                    \n                Jim Murphy is adamant that there is no practical distinction between the comments offered by himself and those tendered by Ed Balls. However, there is perhaps a difference in emphasis.  Mr Balls, countering Tories, talks up the rigour - alongside social justice. Mr Murphy - facing Nationalists - talks social justice and tends to play down the rigour.  To be fair to Mr Murphy, he has cited the Institute for Fiscal Studies to the effect that there might be no need for Labour to introduce \"further\" cuts beyond the present year, 2015/16, in order to achieve the aim of eliminating the current account deficit by the end of the next Westminster Parliament.  Note the words. Further - that is, beyond those presently scheduled. Current account - that is, not including spending for capital investment.  However, the IFS also observed that about \u00a36bn of cuts might be required if Labour is to adhere to the more truncated timetable for balance set out in the Charter for Budget Responsibility, which the party has endorsed. The IFS note adds that \"there is real uncertainty\" about the path to be followed for the public finances.   But the leader of the SNP, Ms Sturgeon, said: \"Labour has admitted today that if there is a Labour government there will be more cuts in Scotland.\"Ed Balls has said that, in direct contradiction to what Jim Murphy has been trying to say over the past week.\"I think that is the wrong choice. Yes, we need to get the deficit down, but we need to do that in a way and at a pace that allows us to invest in infrastructure, in skills and innovation, in things that get the economy growing.\"We need to invest in protecting our public services and we need to have policies that drive people out of poverty, not drive them deeper into poverty.\"\n                        Ed Balls believes the levy on homes worth more than \u00a32m would benefit Scotland\n                    \n                Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson reacted to Mr Balls' comment by saying: \"Yesterday, Jim Murphy said there would be no further cuts for Scotland. Today Ed Balls has pulled him short and confirmed there would be. \"Jim Murphy has had the rug pulled from under his feet by a panicking and shambolic party which seems to have given up on Scotland.\"Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said Labour had \"very little credibility\" on the economy as it wanted to \"borrow far too much than is necessary\". He added: \"Our plan to cut less than the Conservatives and borrow less than the SNP and Labour enables us to commit to building a stronger economy and a fairer society.\"Liberal Democrats have been first out of the blocks in setting out how we would deal with the deficit. The SNP, Labour and the Conservatives must be open with people in Scotland about what is needed to deal with the deficit fairly by 2017/18.\"Labour's manifesto - which was unveiled in Manchester - commits a Labour government to what it calls a \"budget responsibility lock\". This would \"guarantee\" that every policy is paid for without additional borrowing and would, in future, require all the major parties to have their tax and spending plans audited by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility before a general election.Subscribe to the BBC Election 2015 newsletter to get a round-up of the day's campaign news sent to your inbox every weekday afternoon.\n    ", "newspaper": "BBC", "id": 663, "pubdate": "Mon, 13 Apr 2015 17:13:46 +0530", "title": "Balls: Scots 'not exempt' from cuts"}, {"content": "\n                        Better weather has stabilised India's food prices\n                    \n                India's inflation rate fell to a three-month low last month, official figures have shown.Inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) fell to 5.17%, down from February's figure of 5.37%.Better weather has meant agricultural harvests have been more controllable, stabilising the price of food.The dip in global oil prices also helped lower the rate, which is in line with the government's aim of keeping inflation below 6%.Analysts had forecast a rate of about 5.5% for March.

The oxymoronic Fair Tax is collected from the end user at the point of sale, like state and local sales taxes. Both are bad ideas.\n \n \n\n As major tax reform has been lately debated, in addition to tinkering with the current system or replacing it with a flat tax, politicians on both sides of the aisle have proposed consumption tax options. And they will be part of the 2016 presidential campaign debates.\n \n \n\n Fiscally, the attraction of a consumption tax is that, in the largest consumer economy on the planet, it would raise a lot of tax revenue. Politically a consumption tax raises revenue on the rich more appropriately and, even though it\u2019s regressive for the poor, they would receive some kind of a federal rebate or credit.\n \n \n Consider these reasons why either consumption tax is a bad idea: \n We know that the big spending party is the one in the majority. So without imposing strict fiscal discipline \u2013 like a balanced budget amendment \u2013 a consumption tax will give politicians more money without solving budget deficits or national debt challenges. \n  Most European countries have collected consumption taxes for years, and yet they continue to have significant economic/fiscal challenges. \n  European consumption taxes are on top of all other taxes, including income tax. \n  All European consumption tax percentages started small, but today the average is 19% \u2013 again, in addition to income tax. \n A consumption tax would also hurt small businesses disproportionately. Big businesses have systems in place to deal with new government compliance, like tax collection, and they ALWAYS pass along expense increases to customers. Small businesses will be harmed because: \n We aren\u2019t always able to pass along cost increases, even a mandated VAT. \n  New tax compliance and remittance will be prohibitively expensive. \n  The sticker price of a national sales tax will take time for consumers to adjust to, which will hurt small businesses more. \n The only way we should consider any kind of a consumption tax is if it completely replaces the federal income tax, which would require repealing the 16th Amendment. Good luck with that because in the 227 years since the Constitution was ratified, only one amendment has ever been repealed \u2013 and that was to end prohibition. \n Write this on a rock \u2026\u00a0A consumption tax is a bad idea, especially for America\u2019s small businesses. \n \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t", "newspaper": "Forbes", "id": 668, "pubdate": "Mon, 13 Apr 2015 20:32:00 +0530", "title": "A consumption tax is bad for America and worse for America's small businesses"}, {"content": "\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nOver the weekend, Marvel fans across the globe found themselves elated by the 13-episode first season of the company\u2019s first foray into TV-MA television and streaming content, Daredevil. As discussed in the lead-up to the show\u2019s premiere, Daredevil\u2019s done a lot not just for Marvel, but Netflix Netflix as well. The show\u2019s going to open up some much needed doors for the SVOD outlet, doors that are going to allow the service to evolve in serious\u00a0ways. With that said, it should be noted the one thing Daredevil brings to Netflix that will help it more than anything else is the concept of episodic storytelling. \nSomething that immediately stands out about Daredevil is the way in which it chooses to tell its tale. Unlike many other Netflix series such as Orange is the New Black and House of Cards, much of Daredevil\u2019s on-going arcs are told in a format that would easily suit a standard, once-per-week schedule. Just looking at the transition between episodes one and two, we end with Matt jumping off a rooftop to fight crime and then suddenly rejoin him in a dumpster following a fight we never see take place on screen. When played out through a seven days in between schedule, that transition isn\u2019t very jarring. When done in two episodes that many, in theory, watched back-to-back, it\u2019s a highly intriguing way to display Matt\u2019s viglante journey. The dumpster reveal wasn\u2019t even the last time this happened throughout the season. Almost every episode stood on its own within the context of the overall season to a point where the only thing missing was a \u201cpreviously on Marvel\u2019s Dardedevil\u201d montage. \n \nMany fans within the \u201chip\u201d crowd will argue this fact to be a disadvantage, but it\u2019s not because of the source material being utilized. Daredevil\u2019s not Game of Thrones. The character\u2019s comics are not a lengthy set of epic novels\u2026 they\u2019re comics. Each episode acts not like a part of a whole, but a closed off issue of a continuing series. When viewed\u00a0as a complete picture, the first season of Daredevil can be presented as a single entity \u2013 like one would do with a trade release of a multi-issue spanning comic book arc \u2013 but the episodes\u00a0don\u2019t have to be consumed that way like some other Netflix fair. \nJust as the series opens up Netflix to more pulpy, less Emmy seeking programming, it also opens up the company to more \u201ctraditional\u201d shows. In recent years, it\u2019s felt like Netflix was only interested in forcing its creators to make programs that had to be binged. They had to be consumed in the short time-frame of 1-3 days. Unfortunately, what this format doesn\u2019t allow for is Netflix\u2019s take on a medical series, police procedural or court room drama \u2013 genres that are, without question, the most successful when it comes to small screen longevity. Daredevil changes that unwritten mandate, regardless of whether or not it was the intention of the series to do so. \nThrough the success of Daredevil, maybe we\u2019ll finally get to see what happens when Netflix tries to do more than simply compete with HBO. Some may say Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt already proves this theory, but that series was nearly completed with its production when Netflix stepped into the ring. The show won\u2019t have an opportunity to prove Netflix\u2019s capability of doing a \u201cnetwork comedy\u201d until next year. However, Daredevil already proves now that the service can do \u201cnetwork drama\u201d if it wants to. Minus the addition of some more pronounced, realistic violence, there\u2019s really nothing that separates Daredevil from Arrow, and that\u2019ll ultimately prove to be an advantage for Netflix as it continues to grow and roll out more Marvel series in the coming months and years.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t", "newspaper": "Forbes", "id": 669, "pubdate": "Mon, 13 Apr 2015 20:31:00 +0530", "title": "'Daredevil's Episodic Nature is Netflix's Greatest Asset"}, {"content": "\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nIt was announced\u00a0on Friday that Linkedin made a surprise purchase of the online learning website Lynda.com for a cool $1.5 billion. While many in the tech industry scratched their heads over the acquisition, I want to tell you firsthand why this is not only a smart fit, but a great purchase as well. \nI\u2019ve been an author for Lynda since 2011, creating 17 different courses in audio recording and social media. I was impressed from the first day I set foot in Lynda\u2019s door to check things out four years ago. Let me tell you why. \nI hadn\u2019t heard of Lynda.com until Audio Channel Content Manager David Franz was a guest on a roundtable podcast that I\u2019m a part of called AudioNowcast. After the show David suggested that some of my books might be perfect as the basis for a number of courses, which lead to an invitation to come up to their studios to audition. \n\n Lynda.com Inc.\u2019s website. Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n \nI was a bit taken back, and my response was that I regularly give presentations and keynote addresses at industry events and universities around the world and that my YouTube channel already had lots of videos that showcased my abilities for him to check out. \u201cNo offense, but everyone has to go through this,\u201d he replied, so I was off to Oxnard for an on-camera and voice-over \u201cscreen test.\u201d \nThis process turns out to be the essence of why Lynda is more successful than any company in the online training field. \nThe bar is set high for authors. Unlike many teachers and college professors that we\u2019ve all encountered at some time in our lives, you\u2019ve got to not only know your stuff, but you have to be able to present it in a clear and easily understandable fashion too to get a chance to be in the Lynda fold. \nThe company ensures that your presentation is at its best thanks to a crack team of producers (thank you Todd Howard), audio and video editors and special effects specialists that treat every course like a Hollywood production, mostly because so many of them have formerly worked in some facet of Hollywood entertainment. The gear and facilities are top-notch as well, but it\u2019s the attention to detail in each course that makes the difference between\u00a0the end user actually learning something, and the hit or miss video from the anonymous guy with a webcam so often found not only on YouTube, but other similar sites.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tPage 1 / 2\n\n\t\t\t\tContinue \n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t", "newspaper": "Forbes", "id": 670, "pubdate": "Mon, 13 Apr 2015 20:30:00 +0530", "title": "Why LInkedin's Purchase of Lynda.com Is The Best Money It Will Ever Spend"}, {"content": "\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nPart One \nNot a transcript; just detailed notes. \u00a0Errors are mine. \nRelevant stocks: DJCO, BRK.A, PKX,\u00a0DOW,\u00a0TSLA, AMEX, COST, BYDDF, \u00a0KRFT \nQ: I came to be here from India. It is an honor to be here. What is your advice to a 20-year-old individual who wants to achieve financial freedom through investing? Mr. Munger: Achieving success through investments has been pretty easy in my lifetime. If you were rational and disciplined, and you had a tailwind of a 10 percent per annum on average from carefully selected stocks going for you, pre tax, that was a big tailwind. If you saved your money, and you lived within your means, were shrewd and so forth, that was enough to take care of you. A little discipline in saving, and the passage of time will do it. \nNow, if the world is going to get 10 percent out of indexes in the future, and I don\u2019t think it will, in real terms, getting more has proven to be quite difficult. Some of you who come along later are finding that if you stay in the big stocks, it\u2019s damn near impossible for most people. When things are damn near impossible, maybe you could stop trying. \nThat was not my system, but I do not recommend my system to everybody. I do, as a way of life, but I don\u2019t think all you have to do is read Charlie Munger and you\u2019ll get rich. If it were that easy, this place would be a football stadium. \n[laughter] \nMr.\u00a0Salzman, Daily Journal CEO: Charlie says the way to get rich is to keep $10 million in your checking account in case a good deal comes along. \nMr. Munger: By the way, that was the advice of Howard Ahmanson to a young bunch of starving graduates. \n[laughter] \nRich people sometimes get a little pompous. \nQ: Would you give us your thoughts on the Posco [PKX] position in the Daily Journal Portfolio? \nMr. Munger: It\u2019s a very interesting example, as a matter of fact, that shows how hard the world is. That is the most efficient steel company in the world, and it had pretty close to a local monopoly of a whole country for a long, long time. In spite of that, in spite of having some very important steel technology they have that nobody else in the world has, Posco is selling like an ordinary commoditized steel company. \nIt\u2019s very hard to avoid being commoditized in high powered competition in the modern world. In places like Dow Chemical [DOW], have all our complex chemical products commoditized in spite of the fact they\u2019ve got thousands of PhD chemists, and people as talented and brilliant as the people who created Posco just find the markets low and the prices bad and so forth. \nIt shows how hard and dangerous it is to make money in a commoditized business, and how many businesses that you formerly thought were hugely advantaged can be commoditized. So, you\u2019ve done a wonderful service to this meeting by raising the case of Posco. Posco\u2019s an excellent example for everybody to think about. It really shows how hard it is. \nQ: You have said in the past, the private mortgage insurance solution is flawed. Can you talk about why you think the current insurance system like Fannie and Freddie works, and talk about some of the problems with bringing private capital to the mortgage insurance market? \nMr. Munger: You remember what private insurance did in the big financial crisis in the United States. Crazy and immoral, that is not a good combination. They added a third, they were deeply full of pride about the fact that they were crazy and immoral. \nAnd so, they damn near caused a catastrophe. The people who did it have one thing in common, not one has any shame at all. I\u2019ve never seen anybody who contributed to the creation of the great financial crisis with shoddy underwriting, lousy bonds \u2014 I\u2019ve never met anybody who contributed to it who was ashamed of himself. It\u2019s always somebody else\u2019s fault, or maybe the government\u2019s fault. \nThat\u2019s just the way it is. We\u2019ve stumbled by accident, and reacted to a crisis. All the things we did were great expedients, given the terrible problems we had, and it\u2019s working after a fashion. The main risk is, given the political pressures, the government will start going crazy the way everyone did, in reducing the standards and so forth. \nYou keep trying to enable your citizens to vote themselves rich by various stratagems, like unlimited credit to people who don\u2019t deserve credit, which is really a dumb idea. You\u2019d think people would know that by now, but I don\u2019t think they do. I\u2019m satisfied with the current system provided they keep the standards up. \nBut of course, they don\u2019t want to do that, they want to lessen them as fast as they can, and that\u2019s what the politicians will keep urging them to do. I think it\u2019s a terrible idea. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with having a conservative system, like the FHA was in the Great Depression, that happened to involve the government. Letting private agencies and private insurance do as they please? We\u2019ve shown how well that works, our unregulated, wonderful people in finance. I\u2019d rather trust some pathogens. \n \n \nQ: I\u2019d like to get your thoughts on American Express [AMEX]. Do you think its moat has narrowed recently? \nMr. Munger: I don\u2019t think it was desirable that it lost its contract with Costco [COST]. Again, that\u2019s an example of what tough capitalism is. Obviously, other people are willing to do it cheaper. It just shows how tough a position that looks impregnable can be in modern capitalism. It\u2019s what makes everything difficult. \nTo those who already have some money, I think that\u2019s just the way it is, and American Express has had a long period of very extreme achievement and prosperity. I think they\u2019ll have a lot of prosperity in the future, but it doesn\u2019t look quite as easy as it once did. Now, the head guy would say it\u2019s always been hard, he\u2019s been battling hard, but we paddled hard here too, and what good did it do us in Daily Journal\u2019s print business? We paddled like crazy, didn\u2019t we Gerry? \nMr.\u00a0Salzman: We tried. It was hard. \nMr. Munger: Yeah, what happened is you just keep receding and receding. Welcome to adult life. \n[laughter] \nQ: I recently watched an Elon Musk interview on YouTube, in which he said he had lunch with you and you had given him all sorts of reasons why Tesla would fail. \n[laughter] \nWould you be kind enough to educate us why you thought Tesla would fail, and what BYD [ticker: BYDDF] can learn from this? \nMr. Munger:\u00a0I think the auto business is very difficult, very competitive, and everybody is going to make wonderful cars. Everybody already has enormous size and wealth. So, I regarded it as a tough business. Elon Musk is a genius, and so if anybody has a chance to do it, he probably is the man. \nBut we have a saying at Berkshire that when a man with a reputation for genius takes on a business with a reputation for tough operating conditions, it\u2019s the reputation of the business that\u2019s likely to prevail. Without government help, getting electric cars off the ground is really hard. In China, it works a lot better than it does here, because their air is worse. \nWhat Elon Musk really needs is for the whole country to have a disastrous smog attack that kills a lot of people. Short of something terrible like that, I think it\u2019s going to be difficult. He\u2019s a genius, but is going to have to be. \nQ: I\u2019d like to ask you how you read, and how you retain and incorporate that information? Do you have a filing system? \nMr. Munger: No, I\u2019ve never taken notes; I never kept notes when I was student. I would just read what I pleased when I felt like reading it, and I think what I think when I feel like thinking it. That\u2019s my system. \n[laughter] \nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right system for everybody, but it seems to have worked well enough for to get by. \nQ: My question is about so called \u2018robo advisors\u2019. What are your thoughts on the subject? \nMr. Munger: The robo funds are the index funds, the big ones. You can hardly imagine more of a robo fund than an index fund. Of course, they\u2019re beating a large percentage of actively managed money over a long period of years, particularly the people who are managing billions. I just thank God that they didn\u2019t give me the assignment of managing $200 billion and beating the indexes. I would not have welcomed that challenge. \nThe people who still have value in investing are people who are willing to work very diligently and intelligently in less efficient markets. I think it is hard to be a great value investor with $200 billion under management. It takes a long time to buy in, a long time to sell out, other people copy your trades, it\u2019s very difficult. \nQ (Phil DeMuth): Financial economists in recent years have rediscovered that highly profitable, high quality companies are better investments than other companies. They try to figure out where this idea came from, it takes them back to Buffett, and then Buffett points to Munger.\u00a0But this is an insight you had in the 1950s, or maybe the early 1960s, when you were an attorney. How did you come upon this idea? You weren\u2019t even Charlie Munger then.  \n[laughter] \nMr. Munger: Everybody with any sense at all knows that some companies are better than others. What makes it difficult is they sell at higher prices in relation to assets, and earnings and so forth, and that takes the fun out of the game. If all you had to do was figure out which companies were better than others, an idiot could make a lot of money. But they keep raising the prices to where the odds change. \nI always knew that. They were teaching my colleagues that the stock market was so efficient that nobody could beat it. But I knew people who beat the pari mutuel system in Omaha by knowing more about horses than other people. I knew it was bull. When I was young I never went near a business school so I didn\u2019t get polluted by the craziness. \n[laughter] \nI never believed it. I never believed there was a talking snake in the Garden of Eden. I had a gift for recognizing twaddle, and there\u2019s nothing remarkable about it. I don\u2019t have any wonderful insights that other people don\u2019t have. I just avoided idiocy slightly more consistently than others. \nOther people are trying to be smart; all I\u2019m trying to be is non-idiotic. I\u2019ve found that\u2019s all you have to do to get ahead in life, be non-idiotic and live a long time. It\u2019s harder to be non-idiotic than most people think. \nQ: As chairman of a major hospital, can you speak to us about Obamacare? \nMr. Munger: That\u2019s one of the most complex subjects on Earth. Of course, the system of medical care that\u2019s evolved in the United States has much wrong with it. On the other hand, it has much that\u2019s good about it, all new drugs, the new devices, the new operations. \nMedicine has taken more territory in my lifetime than it took in the whole previous history of mankind. It\u2019s just amazing what\u2019s been done, and a lot of it has been obvious and simple, like inoculating children against infantile paralysis, scraping the tartar off your teeth so you don\u2019t wear plates when you\u2019re 55 years old, so on. \nPeople now take those benefits for granted, but I lived in the world where a lot of children died, and every city had a tuberculosis sanitarium, and half the people who got tuberculosis died. It\u2019s just amazing how well medicine has worked. On the other hand, compared to the best it can possibly be, the American system is pretty peculiar. \nIt\u2019s very hard to fix, because one kind of incentive is to pay so much a month for taking care of the people, and everything you save is yours. That is the system the government uses in dealing with convalescent homes. That\u2019s a great name, the \u2018convalescent home\u2019. You convalesce in Heaven; you don\u2019t convalesce in that home. \n[laughter] \nIt\u2019s tempting to have this euphemistic name. But that creates huge incentives to delay care and keep the money, and the government has strict rules and compliance systems and so forth. If we didn\u2019t have that system, the cost of taking care of old people in convalescent homes would be ten times what it is. It was the only feasible solution. \nThe rest of the world is going in that direction because the costs just keep rising. If the government is going to pay A anything he wants for selling services to B, who doesn\u2019t have to pay anything? Of course that system is going to create a lot of unnecessary tests, unnecessary costs, unnecessary procedures, unnecessary interventions. Psychiatrists that keep talking to the patient forever with no improvement. \nOf course that system is going to cause problems, and the alternative system also causes problems. Now, add the fact that you\u2019ve got politicians, and add the fact that you\u2019ve got existing players who are enormously rich and powerful, who lobby like crazy. A state legislature now, with a huge percentage of GDP going through the medical system, just imagine what the lobbying is like. \nSo, we get these Rube Goldberg systems, and we get a lot of abuse of various kinds. There\u2019s hardly an ethical drug company that hasn\u2019t created multiple gross abuses, which in substance go into the bribery of doctors, which of course is illegal. They\u2019ve all committed big follies. \nThe device makers, if anything, have been worse. There\u2019s been a lot of abuse and craziness, and the costs, of course, just keep rising. That\u2019s in a system that averaged out as the greatest achiever in the history of the world. It\u2019s very complicated. \nI think it will get addressed and we probably will end up with systems that are more like we do with the convalescent homes. If you look at medicine, what\u2019s happening is that more and more they\u2019re going to a system where they pay somebody X dollars for everything they say they need. \nThat system has some chance of controlling the cost. If you go into a great medical school hospital today, and you\u2019re within one day of dying of some obvious thing like advanced cancer, the admitting physician is very likely to ask for a test of your cholesterol and every other damn thing, and all the bills go to the government. \nAs long as incentives allow that, people will do it, and they\u2019ll rationalize their behavior. Something has to be done on that, more than is now being done. I think the drift will be more in the direction of block care. I don\u2019t see any other system that would have controlled cost in the convalescent homes. \nBy the way, your doctor can\u2019t just walk by every bed in the convalescent home and send the bill to the government. That\u2019s not allowed by the law. But if you transfer the patient into the hospital, you can walk by the bed five minutes every day, and send a $45 bill to the government. \nIf the incentives are wrong, the behavior will be wrong. I guarantee it. Not by everybody, but by enough of a percentage so that you won\u2019t like the system. I think that\u2019s enough on a subject that\u2019s so difficult. We can see where it\u2019s going. In the Netherlands, they have a system where the same people are giving a free system to everybody and a concierge system to the others. It\u2019s actually working pretty well, so that\u2019s a possibility. \nQ: A question in regarding to the Asian population in the United States. A disproportionate number of us go to elite universities in the U.S., and a lot of us have upper ranked performance in school and have better jobs after school, but very few of us make it to the top of the field, especially in investing. Why do you think that is the case? What\u2019s working against us in this nation? \nMr. Munger: No, what\u2019s working against you are the laws of arithmetic. It\u2019s a strange thing, but exactly 99 percent of the people are at the bottom 99 percent. That will always be true no matter what. Of course very few people will get to the top 1 percent. In fact, only 1 percent gets there. \n[laughter] \nQ (Whitney Tilson): As a long time Berkshire shareholder, I was delighted to see the latest deal with the 3G guys announced last night. I understand you may not be able to comment on that specifically, but could you just talk about your experience with Heinz and with 3G and what you hope for the future? What\u2019s so special about these guys that they\u2019re able to squeeze out such extraordinary performance out of fairly stable, slow growth businesses? \nMr. Munger: Through enormous discipline, enormous will, and enormous intelligence, 3G has adopted a zero-based budgeting system which is more extreme than anybody else\u2019s. Yet they\u2019ve been able to do it time after time in a way where the place ends up as strong or stronger after they\u2019ve removed a lot of the cost. Of course, that\u2019s a very interesting example. \nThe same thing went on in the nonprofit center. When the great financial crisis came, every university I know of laid off 6 percent, 8 percent, 10 percent of their people. I know of no case where the university didn\u2019t work better after they got rid of the 10 percent. None. Zero. Successful places tend to get bloated, fat, complacent. It\u2019s the nature of human life. \nSomebody who is tough enough, shrewd enough, who knows enough not to cut the wrong things and to do everything fair, has an opportunity to buy things and cut out expenses they don\u2019t really need. 3G is probably the most extreme large operation in the world doing that. \nI actually think they will probably end up increasing the sales as well. What\u2019s interesting about 3G is they\u2019re teaching us something about reality: namely, that successful places contain a lot of unnecessary people\u2026I could have told them that by observing them. If you went into the Department of Agriculture, would you have the feeling the thing was understaffed? \n[laughter] \nI think you\u2019d find many a corporate headquarters going, \u201cWhat in the hell are all these people doing?\u201d \nNow the Daily Journal I do not think is overstaffed. I don\u2019t think it ever has been. Gerry, what\u2019s your comment on that? He\u2019s watched it all these years. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve had a lot of unnecessary costs ever. \nMr.\u00a0Salzman: We haven\u2019t had a lot of unnecessary costs. At one time, the Daily Journal by itself had approximately 300 employees. Now, we have about 150 employees. You can see that we have taken the direction of the company and reduced expenses accordingly.If you take the foreclosure business, which went from about 2006 to 2011 just like that, we added one and a half people to handle all of that additional work. When the boom went the other direction, we eliminated the one and half plus maybe a little bit more. So we tried to be ahead of the game in terms of anticipating and certainly using technology, because that\u2019s the way we were able to handle that particular sequence of events. \nMr. Munger: But, normally, if you\u2019re super successful, if the sky rains gold, everybody\u2019s president gets an assistant. Pretty soon, the assistant has an assistant. It\u2019s just the way human nature works. It\u2019s like cancer. Somebody who\u2019s really tough about that can remove a lot of costs, but only from certain kinds of companies. 3G would perish if it tried to reduce a lot of costs at the Daily Journal. They would starve to death. \n[laughter] \nQ: Indexing has grown a lot in the last 30 years. You once said that if we ever get to the point where everybody\u2019s indexing, it\u2019s not going to work very well. \nMr. Munger: It\u2019s far enough away from happening so that I don\u2019t spend much time thinking about it. I think human nature is such that it will never happen. I don\u2019t spend much time thinking about what is almost certain never to happen.In the world as it is, indexing has gained a lot. It probably should have gained a lot, because it\u2019s quite rational. It\u2019s bad for a lot of people who would otherwise be earning money as stock pickers. It probably should have been bad for those people. \nIt doesn\u2019t make it pleasant to have it happen, any more than it helped Japan have a pleasant time when Korea came up so fast as a competitive powerhouse, and even more so when China rose. But I think indexing is here to stay. \nIf you stop to think about it, civilized man has always had soothsayers, shamans, faith healers, and God knows what all. The stock picking industry is four or five percent super rational, disciplined people, and the rest of them are like faith healers or shamans.And that\u2019s just the way it is, I\u2019m afraid. It\u2019s nice that they keep an image of being constructive, sensible people when they\u2019re really would-be faith healers. It keeps their self respect up. \n[laughter] \n*** \nTo be continued\u2026\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t", "newspaper": "Forbes", "id": 671, "pubdate": "Mon, 13 Apr 2015 20:20:00 +0530", "title": "Charlie Munger's 2015 Daily Journal Annual Meeting - Part 2"}, {"content": "\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nAccording to Freud, the uncanny refers to the juxtaposition of the weird and dark with the familiar. It is this peculiar intimacy that audiences find so alluring in many of television\u2019s recent hits, such as Netflix's Netflix's Hemlock Grove and HBO\u2019s True Detective. \nTrue Detective, in particular, has taken advantage of the dark and twisted. Not only are Rust and Marty embroiled in the grim chase for a serial killer, but these protagonists also participate in the darkness, bending the rules and battling their own inner demons. \u00a0This complexity has led to public and critical acclaim: The first season\u2019s finale set an HBO ratings record, and the show garnered numerous Golden Globe nominations and Emmy wins. \n\n Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson in \u201cTrue Detective.\u201d (AP Photo/HBO, Michele K. Short)\n \nThe show also saw financial success. HBO took a gamble on the its\u00a0unique production \u2014 True Detective went straight to series with the majority of creative control maintained by the writer, director and producers, not HBO. And it paid off: Because HBO is a subscription service, it is mainly concerned with retaining audience members. With ratings that grew each week, True Detective did the trick, becoming another reason for people to keep paying $15 a month for the channel. \nThe show\u2019s unconventional darkness, as well as its unconventional format, was the theme for a panel discussion at Brown University\u2019s Ivy Film Festival on Friday \u2014 the day after True Detective released its season two trailer \u2014 featuring True Detective\u2019s executive producer Richard Brown and Hemlock Grove star Dougray Scott. The Scottish duo openly discussed the bitter competition between HBO and Netflix, how television has become a seller\u2019s market and the similarities between\u00a0their shows, which mostly stem from a break with TV\u2019s\u00a0traditional formula. \nNeither show followed the typical television production model in which an idea, not an entire series, is picked up by a network. Instead, these shows were made much like films, with the entire series developed prior to being bought. This allowed for immense creativity for the shows\u2019 makers, as they did not have to contend with as much input from the network. The developers benefited from the current TV landscape in which platforms \u2014 Netflix and HBO have a particularly antagonistic rivalry \u2014 are so competitive that they are willing to relinquish some\u00a0control if a series shows promise. \nThe two shows also both have literary roots \u2014 Hemlock Grove is based on a book of the same name, and True Detective was written by Nic Pizzolatto as a \u201cnovel for television.\u201d This allows for\u00a0characters with more depth who \u201cresonate the very real themes of confusion, passion, self-discovery, disappointment, and tragedy,\u201d Scott said. Also, like in a novel, the storylines cannot run forever, but have distinct beginnings, middles and ends, which is why True Detective will run\u00a0as an anthology. \nOne cannot watch either show without noticing the cinematic qualities to them, particularly the aesthetic mixture of the beautiful and the absurd. Both Scott and Brown said\u00a0this was due to\u00a0the creative freedom given to the shows\u2019 developers\u00a0\u2014\u00a0something Scott attributed to the platforms\u00a0knowing they have to take risks and innovate in order\u00a0to retain a\u00a0modern audience.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tPage 1 / 5\n\n\t\t\t\tContinue \n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t", "newspaper": "Forbes", "id": 672, "pubdate": "Mon, 13 Apr 2015 20:15:00 +0530", "title": "In Exclusive Q &amp; A, 'True Detective' Producer Explains How TV Became The Land With No Rules"}, {"content": "\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nSomeday someone\u2019s going to write a really terrific history of how technology affects politics, starting with Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s grasp of radio, wandering through Jack Kennedy\u2019s mastery of television, and concluding with Barack Obama\u2019s use of social media in 2008 and big data in 2012. \nThe next election in the U.S. is more than a year away (which hasn\u2019t stopped politicians from declaring their intentions), but folks in other countries are already thinking about how big data can influence their own federal elections in 2015. It looks like big data\u2019s next act \u2013 after helping Obama in 2012 \u2013 is to amplify the vox populi (or as my language teacher Miss McNamara translated on the day we literally covered an entire blackboard with Latin phrases, the voice of the people). \nThis could be a truly noble effort. It seems that the less people trust government, the less they vote. As tech entrepreneur Giovanna Mingarelli noted in Huffington Post Canada last week, in anticipation of her country\u2019s federal election this year, in the 2011 Canadian Federal Election, only 38.8% of Canadians aged 18 to 24 voted.This same group, she adds, is \u201chyperconnected\u201d and sharing data across social networks almost constantly. \n\u201cAn examination of this dynamic data will help us see in real-time what young people are doing, where they\u2019re going and who they like (or not), for instance. In fact, this data could even be analyzed to explore the activities that are shaping their perceptions and expectations of governments and political parties.\u201d \n\u201cWhat\u2019s more,\u201d Mingarelli adds, \u201cif we could better understand the reality of what\u2019s happening with youth at the grassroots level, by the data they\u2019re creating on a daily basis, it could make it a lot easier for governments, political parties and key stakeholders to create authentic, evidence-based campaigns \u2014 rooted in the actual needs of young people in Canada \u2014 that have real, actionable value.\u201d I like the way this woman thinks. \nCoincidentally, Jamie Carter asked on TechRadarPro about the same time if big data could determine who wins the general election in the UK next month, asking if it will be the country\u2019s first \u201cdata-driven vote.\u201d He quotes an OpenText executive as saying, \u201cIn previous elections it was the spin doctors and the media that influenced the election outcome. Perhaps in 2015 it will be the data scientists who have the most influence.\u201d \nThere\u2019s no consensus there yet, as an Acxiom executive counters that \u201cthe UK\u2019s political parties are nowhere near as advanced in their use of analytics platforms and databases compared to the U.S.\u201d But the goals are clear: \u201cBy knowing voters better it will lead to better, more responsive government, and parties that would vie to embody our desires perfectly,\u201d says a Cloudera executive. The article doesn\u2019t go so far as to indicate which party it thinks will be ruling the UK come summer. \nFor those that remember the 2012 election here in the U.S., you know that the FiveThirtyEight.org web site, led by now-legendary statistician Nate Silver, went a long way toward legitimizing big data in political efforts. So while Canada and the UK are focusing on federal elections, it\u2019s interesting to check in to see what Silver is doing in the lull before the 2016 election.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tPage 1 / 2\n\n\t\t\t\tContinue \n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t", "newspaper": "Forbes", "id": 673, "pubdate": "Mon, 13 Apr 2015 20:00:00 +0530", "title": "Big Data Next Act: Amplifying The Vox Populi"}, {"content": "\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMicrosoft Microsoft has touted the Xbox One\u2019s ability to be instantly booted with voice commands since launch, and its game restore feature is something that rival PS4 has only recently been able to adopt. But the functionality of an \u201cInstant-on\u201d console comes with a cost, as the NRDC laid out in a recent study of new-gen console power usage. \nMicrosoft especially was hit hard with data about the Xbox One\u2019s \u201crest state\u201d which allows for instant on functionality. By hibernating in a low power mode, the system is able to instantly kick back on even in the middle of a game, and it\u2019s what allows Kinect to respond to voice commands even when the system is sleeping. But the NRDC says that this ability is costing gamers $250M a year in total on their electric bills, given the amount of power the system uses in \u201crest state\u201d as opposed to just plain \u201coff.\u201d \nTaking this report to heart, Microsoft has come out with a new part of the set-up process for the Xbox One which specifically asks consumers which type of power plan they want their Xbox One to have going forward. Billed as \u201cEnergy Saving\u201d and \u201cInstant-on,\u201d the choice screen lists only the negatives of the former (slower start-up, interrupting updates) and the benefits of the latter (instant on, auto-updates). Though I suppose the term \u201cenergy saving\u201d is supposed to be self-explanatory. \n \n \nMicrosoft downplayed the financial cost of instant functionality as they debuted the new set-up screen, and pumped up why Instant-on is worthwhile. \n\u201cWhen factoring the monthly system updates, new features in apps and games and automatic mobile purchase downloads, the Instant-on setting easily saves users countless hours of needlessly waiting\u2026.While we believe Instant-on provides the best experience for our fans, we also believe in providing consumer choice which is why we offered the \u201cEnergy-saving\u201d mode. This lower power state consumes less energy and can save customers an average of $6 to $15 in energy costs* per year in the U.S.\u201d \nRight now Xbox One owners can indeed change their power options, but for all systems sold so far, Instant-on\u00a0has been the default option. Many players may not even realize their system has been in a low power state since they plugged it in,\u00a0given that unlike the PS4 which has at least a soft yellow \u201crest\u201d light, the Xbox One just looks and sounds completely off. To turn the system truly \u201coff,\u201d system owners have to either unplug it, or change their power options buried inside Xbox One\u2019s often abrasive UI. \nLow power states have a long way to go in both consoles, as the tech is rife with issues despite its good intentions. Other than the cost itself (which isn\u2019t insubstantial), I\u2019ve had countless issues with games or apps glitching after being restored from a low power state on Xbox One. Games like Destiny or apps like HBO Go I\u2019ve often had to quit out of completely in order to get them to start working properly again. When instant on does work, it\u2019s certainly convenient, but quitting and restarting the game when needed negates that benefit.The Xbox One isn\u2019t alone in having\u00a0these issues\u00a0either. Now that Sony Sony has introduced similar functionality into the PS4, that has come\u00a0with its own set of problems\u00a0as well. Now, rather than having a quick way to shut off the system, PS4 defaults to rest mode, and you have\u00a0to go into an additional screen to turn the system fully off. Past that, the introduction of the restore functionality is said to be in part responsible for the recent Bloodborne glitch where a \u201cmemory leak\u201d when the game is left on for too long (even in rest mode) can cause the enemy AI to lose IQ points, which in my playthrough (and that of many other players) hard bosses become stupidly easy to beat without access to their full moveset. It actually ruined the entire ending of Bloodborne for me before I realized what was going on. \nI\u2019m all in favor of instant on consoles that install updates when I\u2019m gone and allow me to jump back into a game in a matter of seconds. I don\u2019t even care that much about the energy cost. But given how glitchy the system has been, it still has a long way to go, and at times, is more trouble than it\u2019s worth. If I had to do it over again, I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019d tell my Xbox One to default to, but I suppose it\u2019s a step forward that Microsoft is now allowing players to choose during set-up. \nFollow me\u00a0on Twitter, like my page\u00a0on Facebook,\u00a0and pick up a copy of my sci-fi novel,\u00a0The Last Exodus,\u00a0and\u00a0its sequel,\u00a0The Exiled Earthborn, along with my new Forbes book,\u00a0Fanboy Wars. \nWhat would a truly great Game of Thrones video game look like? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t", "newspaper": "Forbes", "id": 674, "pubdate": "Mon, 13 Apr 2015 19:52:00 +0530", "title": "Microsoft Offering 'Instant On' Alternative After Xbox One's Energy Bill Accusations"}, {"content": "\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nForbes Media\u2019s Ad Product team is currently seeking a Project Manager for post sales campaign execution.\u00a0 Programs may include editorial sponsorships and custom rich-media digital units that will require work with various internal stakeholders.

Jana calculates that Qualcomm trades at just 9-times earnings, when excluding the company\u2019s $30 billion in cash. However, at\u00a0that at that multiple, Jana believes Qualcomm\u2019s chipset business, which earned $3.5 billion in profits before tax in 2014, is being given no value by the market. \n\n A Qualcomm logo.\n \nAccording to Jana, Qualcomm can better demonstrate the value of its chipset business \u2013 known at Qualcomm CDMA Technologies or (QCT) \u2013 and its licensing businesses business \u2013 known as Qualcomm Technology Licensing or (QTL) \u2013 by either separating the divisions into independent publicly traded companies, or by combining them. Speaking about Qualcomm\u2019s low valuation, Jana said it believes the gap can \u201cbe\u00a0addressed by either better demonstrating the unique operational value provided by combining the chipset and licensing businesses or by evaluating a partial or full separation of the businesses, something the company has considered in the past.\u201d \nOther corporate changes Jana is\u00a0proposing\u00a0include a renewed focus on corporate costs and a targeted 400 basis point improvement in margins by the end of 2015, a shift in performance incentives away from revenue and operating income targets and the introduction of more specific metrics such as earnings per share, or return on invested capital. Additionally, Jana recommended Qualcomm reduce the size of its 15-member board and consider new directors with \u201can owner orientation and a focus on operational performance\u201d \nAs Qualcomm considers strategic change and a potential restructuring of its business, Jana applauded the company\u2019s recently announced $15 billion stock repurchase, which represents almost 30% of its market cap, however, the hedge fund said $10 billion earmarked for buybacks over the next 12-months can be done on an accelerated basis. \n\u201c[T]he $10 billion to be deployed over the next twelve months can be deployed sooner, ahead of realizing value from the additional self-help steps it can pursue, and, provided Qualcomm remains undervalued, this should be immediately followed by aggressively deploying the remaining $5 billion,\u201d Jana said. \nIn the past, Jana\u2019s been a strong proponent of accelerated stock repurchases amid large corporate transformations. After Walgeeens Boots Alliance decided against inverting its corporate headquarters from Illinois to Europe during\u00a0the second leg of\u00a0its takeover of Alliance Boots,\u00a0Jana\u00a0lobbied for a renewed focus on buybacks. That\u2019s proven a right-minded recommendation, as Walgreen Walgreen Boots Alliance has been one of the best performers on the S&amp;P 500 in 2015.Jana also said\u00a0Qualcomm might find an interested buyer of chipset business in Intel Intel, if a split proves too time consuming or risky. Recently, NXP Semiconductors NXP Semiconductors and Freescale Semiconductors merged in one of the biggest deals of 2015, and Intel was reported to be looking at buying Altera Altera, however, the deal has stalled over negotiations on price. \n\u201cOver the past several months we have been engaged in a constructive dialogue with the company regarding the steps it can take to restore investor confidence and unlock shareholder value\u2026\u00a0We expect that aggressive execution of the following steps, coupled with the realization of our favorable fundamental outlook for the business, will close the significant price to value gap reflected in the share price,\u201d Jana said. \nQualcomm shares were rising over 1.5% to $70.47 in early Monday trading.

They relied on big software packages, and ignored innovation, even as industries from manufacturing to retail found new ways to leverage technology to improve their operational efficiency. \nThose days are over. To say that health care is changing is an understatement. The move from volume to value isn\u2019t just a fad. After all, the U.S. health system ranks last among wealthy countries for quality, access and efficiency. While other industries across America compete on value, health care \u2014 with its tangled regulations and opaque pricing \u2014 has remained stuck in the past. Pressures are now rising that will force a change: Payers are squeezing reimbursement levels, and higher deductibles are turning patients into price shoppers.The result is that it\u2019s no longer enough to keep racking up procedures and billing without regard for patients\u2019 experiences. Instead, hospitals and other health networks must start thinking like consumer-products companies, and learn how to build customer loyalty with lower prices, shorter wait times, increased convenience and other ways of making the (never pleasant) experience of going to the doctor or hospital better for patients. \n\n (photo source: iStock)\n \n\u201cCIOs will need to re-evaluate the software they\u2019re buying, why they\u2019re buying it, and what it can do for the organization as a whole. As in other industries that have led the way to a more holistic view of the uses of technology, health care, too, must change.\u201d \nTechnology can help with these broader goals, but for IT leaders, this represents a giant shift. They will need to change long-accepted ways of doing things. While such disruption is never easy, there is no other choice, and most IT leaders are starting to realize it. \nIn this new world, CIOs will need to re-evaluate the software they\u2019re buying, why they\u2019re buying it, and what it can do for the organization as a whole. As in other industries that have led the way to a more holistic view of the uses of technology, health care, too, must change. It\u2019s no longer okay for IT to be an ever-growing overhead; instead, it must become a tool for lowering costs and increasing revenues. \nThe result is that monolithic hospital IT systems, like Epic Epic, Cerner Cerner and Meditech, which cost a fortune, yet prohibit you from incorporating new and innovative apps or even from using your own data to improve operations, are no longer the right solution. Instead, IT leaders need to demand new cloud-based solutions that have real interoperability.This won\u2019t be easy, and as a long-time IT leader, I know how tough it can be. I\u2019ve spent a good portion of my career making presentations to CIOs, CFOs and CEOs about the economics of using cloud-based services and solutions, and heard their push back and their stories of how hard it was to contemplate change. And I\u2019ve been through the change myself. \nIn future posts in this four-part series, I\u2019ll share my own story of that change, detailing how the national rehab services provider where I worked rolled out handheld devices, connecting all of its far-flung physical therapists to great effect, as well as directly address some of the issues that naysayers raise, including security concerns.Peel away all the fears, and rethinking technology becomes a simple business decision: In today\u2019s tougher economic climate, particularly for health care, it\u2019s no longer viable to spend millions of dollars on technology without doing a deep analysis of what the return on investment will be from that spending. We need to break the grip that the large hospital software systems have on us, so that we can incorporate new and innovative software and apps, now being developed, to improve our operations and increase patient satisfaction. Only then will IT leaders truly have done their job. \nThis story previously appeared\u00a0on The Health Leadership Forum.\u00a0 \nDick Escue is the Chief Information Officer of Valley View Hospital in Glenwood Springs, Colo, with 25 years of healthcare IT experience under his belt.

So when a friend of mine hosted a Russian college-aged student named Anna for a year so she could take English classes, I agreed to help out if she ever needed to navigate the American medical system. Anna had insurance provided through her program, and she was in good health, so I wasn\u2019t too worried that we would encounter much beyond the ordinary. \nSeveral months into her stay in Boston, she met a young man and the two started dating. A few months after that, she asked to speak with me in private. \u201cMy boyfriend told me that he just tested positive for Chlamydia,\u201d she confessed to me, completely distressed. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what I should do.\u201d \nAfter confirming that they, in fact, had been sexually active and had not used a condom consistently, I sent her to see a primary care physician. She indeed tested positive, was treated, returned for testing, and subsequently had a clean bill of health. At this point, I thought the story was over. \n\n (photo source: iStock)\n \nBut just a week later, Anna got an explanation of benefits (this is not a bill) in the mail stating that her insurance had covered everything but her co-pay, which was a great reassurance. She finished up her stay in the U.S. and went home to Russia. \nDespite my best efforts, I still have been unable to determine exactly what the different costs on each bill are for \u2026 At times, I wonder how much money the health system\u2019s billing department has spent trying to figure out how much she owes. \nAbout two months after Anna arrived home, the Boston-area health system where she saw a primary care physician began sending my friend, her host family, bills for Anna\u2019s medical care.At first, my friend thought there had been a mistake, but when the bills kept coming, she turned to me for help. After several calls to both the health system and Anna\u2019s student insurance, we determined that the insurance covers most primary care, EXCEPT anything related to sexually transmitted infections. \nThe care was originally approved because the insurance thought it was a routine check up. However, when the purpose of the visit was found to be for testing and treatment of a sexually transmitted disease, none of the care was covered. To make matters worse, the health system was unable to consolidate all of the separate bills into one and was unable to explain some duplicate charges on the same day of service. \nAll in all, the episode cost Anna somewhere from $350 to approximately $1200. Despite our best efforts, the health system still cannot tell us the final amount that she owes and seems content to continue sending bills. I knew that with\u00a0the new health care price transparency law\u00a0that went into effect at the beginning of the year, physicians were theoretically responsible for informing patients of medical prices upfront. \nI also knew that most physicians have no idea whatsoever how much services they provide or request cost. \nWhat shocked me with Anna\u2019s case, however, was that the billing office was unable to give us a breakdown of the prices, even after the services had occurred. Not to mention that this particular patient had a physician advocate who was a native English-speaker and who had worked in the same hospital system. \nDespite my best efforts, I still have been unable to determine exactly what the different costs on each bill are for. In the meantime, my friend continues to receive a new bill every two weeks, each addressed to Anna, and each with a different payment requested. At times, I wonder how much money the health system\u2019s billing department has spent trying to figure out how much she owes. \nSeveral weeks ago I played a dinner game with a few of my physician friends; each of us would try to read the bills and figure out exactly how much Anna would owe if she paid the full amount. \nAlthough the game was lighthearted, we all realized the importance of the medical transparency law \u2014 both in its legal ramifications as well as keeping Massachusetts health care costs in check.Once the results of the game were in, we finally had our answer to the question \u201cHow many doctors does it take to read a hospital bill?\u201d The answer: all of us. \nThis post previously\u00a0appeared \u00a0on\u00a0The Health Leadership Forum. \nSylvia Romm, MD MPH is a Pediatric Hospitalist and founder of MilkOnTap.com.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t", "newspaper": "Forbes", "id": 678, "pubdate": "Mon, 13 Apr 2015 19:40:00 +0530", "title": "How Many Doctors Does It Take To Read A Hospital Bill?"}, {"content": "\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nBy Mahek Shah, MD \nThe health care industry has always been changing, but what is different about our industry now is that the pace of change has sped up. Keeping up with those changes is almost impossible. More so when day-to-day activity prevents leaders from strategic planning the next three to five year direction of their organization. \nHere then are three technology trends underlying much of the change happening in healthcare right now: \nCloud-based Electronic Health Records (EHR) \nThere is a growing demand from consumers towards greater access to and portability of their health information. Initiatives such as Blue Button are a reaction to this demand. \nExpect to see a continued trend of cloud-based EHR adoption because they are more agile, adaptable, and flexible for both consumers and providers of healthcare. \nFor example, athenahealth was able to push Ebola-related patient travel history questions to its EHR athenaClinicals within an hour of the media frenzy over a Dallas hospital\u2019s inability to treat Ebola patient Thomas Duncan. Duncan has since died as a result of the hospital sending him home first. \nTraditional software implementations are just not capable of pushing seamless updates in near real-time like cloud-based EHRs can. Further, some cloud-based EHR providers also wrap ancillary business- and information-services around the software, enabling doctors to concentrate more on what they do best: practice medicine and improve the quality of life for patients.These other services create a better experience for both patient and provider. The cloud-based EHR field is crowded; Epic and Cerner, two of the largest client-server based EHRs, should take note or they will become less relevant (remember Blackberry circa 2007?). Within five years\u2019 time, these traditional client-server vendors will need follow suit and move toward a cloud-based model. \n \n \nPatient-Centric Devices \nWe\u2019ve seen a surge of wearables entering the marketplace and they were amongst the most popular topics at this year\u2019s TEDMED and SXSW. I have been wearing my Jawbone UP for about 18 months, increasing my awareness of and attention to ongoing quantifiable personal data, such as fitness, diet, and sleep-quality. \nImagine a diabetic\u2019s biochip detecting blood glucose levels within personalized parameters, and then initiating appropriate, immediate, remedial and automatic action such as insulin-dosing.We are in the early innings of the wearable game in health care as the Apple Apple Watch demonstrated; but even the two data points of sleep and physical activity have augmented my own reflections on personal health, energy, and mood. When I don\u2019t get the right amount of quality sleep, it affects my performance the following day. Now, without any extra effort of documentation, the device records my cycles for later correlation with my own observations. This information will empower patients and consumers to take greater control of their own health by creating a measurable feedback-loop with which they can experiment through more healthful activities. \nAlong with wearables, biosensors are advancing to the point at which, within the next five years, they will not only become incorporated into clothing (Athos, Under Armour Under Armour, etc.) but within our bodies. Imagine a diabetic\u2019s biochip detecting blood glucose levels within personalized parameters, and then initiating appropriate, immediate, remedial and automatic action such as insulin-dosing. Sensors will soon provide doctors valuable feedback for a range of chronic conditions: a pacemakers\u2019 use in heart arrhythmias, efficacy (or side effects) of prescribed medications, and dosing compliance, including chemotherapy. \nThese devices represent the possibility of consumerization within health care. Patient-centric devices \u2013 beyond just smartphones or even watches \u2014 will help not only awareness, but more importantly personal control of health. They will create a progressive model of care, in which health care institutional involvement\u2013whether hospital, clinic, or doctor\u2019s office\u2013occurs at later stages when most needed. This will lead to both financial and time savings for consumers and providers, as well as a better health care experience. \nBig Data Analytics &amp; Patient AccessAnalytics will provide valuable insights in operations and more importantly, at the point of care. But analytics alone won\u2019t be a panacea unless organizations and providers must also have more robust patient access tools. Analytics become important when organizations act on those insights. \nCurrently, many of the big data analytics and insights revolve just around operations. It is there that administrators revise, improve, and streamline workflows to reduce costs, deliver higher quality care, and reduce 30-day readmissions, garnering higher levels of patient satisfaction. \nFor providers, the Holy Grail of big data analytics will be at the point of care through data-enrichment, whereby algorithms and other powerful digital technologies become an essential tool in the doctor\u2019s toolkit. Operationally, leveraging health insights and pivoting this knowledge into targeted patient outreach and access is what makes analytics so powerful. \nCompanies and startups in the healthcare analytics space will no doubt change the way healthcare is delivered and practiced. It\u2019s an exciting time be in the industry and I look forward to seeing how these three technology trends continue to impact the goal of reducing costs and increasing quality. \n \n Mahek Shah, MD, is a medical designer and the founder and managing partner of Symplexi. \n \nThis story previously appeared\u00a0on The Health Leadership Forum.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t", "newspaper": "Forbes", "id": 679, "pubdate": "Mon, 13 Apr 2015 19:37:00 +0530", "title": "3 Technology Trends Transforming Health Care"}, {"content": "\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nBy Eben Harrell \nLast year, a headline on the BBC News website caught my eye:\u00a0 \u201cHave the Danes Cracked Childhood Obesity?\u201d \nThe article profiled Jens Christian Holm, a pediatrician in the town of Holbaek in Northeastern Denmark, who has introduced a protocol to help children achieve weight loss by adjusting various elements of their lifestyle. The protocol, called the The Children\u2019s Obesity Clinic\u2019s Treatment, has thus far treated 1,950 patients and helped 70% of them to maintain normal weight. It is now being rolled out to other districts in Denmark. \nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one in three children in America is now overweight and the incidence of obesity amongst adolescents has quadrupled over the past 30 years\u2014yet anti-obesity, chronic-care campaigns in the U.S. have had mixed results. \nI recently sat down with Dr. Holm to discuss the program and its relevance to the American health system. \n \n \nHEALTH LEADERSHIP FORUM: The BBC headline asked \u201cHave the Danes Cracked Childhood Obesity?\u201d How would you answer that question? \nJENS CHRISTIAN HOLM: The first thing to say is that it\u2019s a huge statement and there\u2019s a question mark at the end of the headline.\u00a0 But we have established results here in Denmark showing we are able to reduce the degree of child obesity in 70-80% of children by investing 5.4 hours of health professional time, per child per year. These results are standout. But we haven\u2019t cracked it totally because 70% is not 100% and all of them do not become normal weight.HLF: What separates your program from the myriad other anti-obesity campaigns around the world? \nHolm: First you need to understand obesity as a chronic disease like asthma, diabetes, epilepsy. And then you know to make chronic treatment. Then you need to understand that weight loss is not the most important thing. The most important thing is weight maintenance. \nObesity is a chronic disease with a fiercely defending hormone system. So you need to assess the patient\u2019s whole picture, because if you don\u2019t then the body will counteract the weight loss by reducing energy cost or maybe taking in extra calories in order to regain weight. \nHLF: Can you briefly summarize your pilot program, what it is trying to achieve and what will happen next? \nHolm: I established the Childhood Obesity Clinic in late 2007. Since then we have taken nearly 2000 children into treatment and 75% of these children have reduced their degree of obesity as well as cholesterols, hypertension, steatosis (fatty liver) and visceral (abdominal) fat. \nOur patients are asked through a 7-page questionnaire about their breakfast, lunch, dinner, soda, juice, ice tea, cocoa, sweets, snacking, activities, inactivities, comfort eating, picky eating, rapid eating, sleeping patterns. I ask them questions about every aspect of their lives and correct everything which counteracts weight loss or weight accumulation. We give detailed advice based on these questions to each individual family (eds note: you can learn more about the protocol here). \nUsing this very large sample, we have been documenting and substantiating what we are doing at all times. We have also managed to include eight further independent treatment clinics across Denmark and these clinics have achieved an 80% weight loss and that has never been seen before. \nMost people have thought that our approach is not possible with low income families, but our results are independent on low social class in more than 3000 patients in the clinics and we have a 70%-80% weight loss result.HLF: What is the role of families and how long will they participate? \nYou can\u2019t treat a child of 4- to 8-years-old when their parents or legal guardians are not involved in the process. It\u2019s totally impossible. So we say that if the child cannot drink soda, there should be no soda in the house. And then the mother may say to me \u201cwhat about the older sibling?\u2019 And I say why would you give the child you love something that is bad for it? Soda has nothing to do with nutrition. \nIn general, the patient child and family are welcome until they are 18 years old. But most stop before that because they have learned and feel they do not need to be taken care of any more. \nHLF: Do you think America can learn anything from a country with different norms and health habits? \nHolm: The problems I\u2019m addressing are universal. Mothers are getting desperate all over the world. So we\u2019re talking about a universal condition. Obesity is a chronic disease regulated by a hormone system and that has nothing to do with the different culture here or in the USA. If American society \u2013 that is the mothers, the children in themselves \u2013 want to lose weight, I can help them. \nThis story previously appeared on\u00a0The Health Leadership Forum.\u00a0 \nEben Harrell is the executive editor of the Health Leadership Forum.

The former of the two categories consists of series such as Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead. In the latter, however, is where you\u2019ll find the likes of Hannibal and the about to return Orphan Black. Since its premiere in 2012, the Tatiana Maslany starring sci-fi drama has served home to one of television\u2019s most gripping performances and most passionate fanbases. Now, following a second season reveal that left audiences floored, the show\u2019s ready to do the most important thing it can going into season three: expand. \nFollowing the reveal of the newly discovered Castor program \u2013 a military controlled, male based cloning experiment \u2013 Sarah and her sisters find themselves in a whole new world of problems with Topside now beginning to grow concerned over the idea of self-aware Leda subjects. With their world coming unraveled, things only go from bad to worse as the male clones of the military outfit begin invading the sisters\u2019 lives in some very intrusive ways. Unfortunately, though, their endgame is still a mystery to everyone. \n \nWisely, the writers of Orphan Black spent the first two seasons building their universe in tiny increments that chose to put more emphasis on character action and purpose over plot twists. But, with the Castor unveiling, the world of the series must now be expanded just for the sake of accommodating that many more personalities. Luckily, based on the first two episodes, it can be said the series pulls off this expansion successfully. Not so much in the season premiere \u2013 which puts most of the focus on the sisters \u2013 but rather in episode 2 where we really get a sense of the show\u2019s scope. \nPraise doesn\u2019t come without a tiny bit of worry heading into the new season, though, as something still lacking in the first two episodes is the purpose of the show\u2019s all mighty Topside. The hope in season two was that the entity would be fleshed out more through the concept of a self-aware Leda clone in Rachel. However, elaboration of the its mission was never made very clear, and that cloudiness remains even as we now explore the concepts of Castor and its ultimate purpose. \nMaslany\u2019s once again knocking it out of the park in her various roles, and her new male counter-part, Ari Millen, is no slouch either. However, great performance alone is only going to get the show so much further. The characters are a lot of fun, but after two seasons of wonderful\u00a0identity building, it\u2019s time to finally start getting all the ducks in a row. It\u2019s time for the show to start actually telling its story instead of continuing to tread water. \nOverall, there are a lot of things to be excited for from the new season of Orphan Black as the show\u2019s returning with some serious fires running hot under its rear-end\u2026 fires that are taking certain aspects of the show to some brilliant places. But, it shouldn\u2019t be noted the show is returning without some of its all-too-familiar convoluted nature. Luckily, that confusion appears to be the result of a fresh lying of foundation, and come the end of the season, there\u2019s a high likelihood many more things will become clear from what presently isn\u2019t. \nOrphan Black premieres Saturday, April 18th at 9/8c on BBC America.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t", "newspaper": "Forbes", "id": 681, "pubdate": "Mon, 13 Apr 2015 19:31:00 +0530", "title": "'Orphan Black' Review: Expansion Is the Name of Season Three's Game"}, {"content": "\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nAs a predictor of the economy, the stock market rises before profits and sales actually improve and vice versa.

The Wall Street Journal called it a low-key start, posting \u201ca video online, followed by small events with voters spaced out slowly over coming weeks.\u201d \nThe news was immediately greeted with a fair amount of doubt and derision.  \nIan Tuttle of the conservative National Review\u00a0scoffed, \u201cBecause nothing says \u2018dialogue\u2019 like a pre-recorded video.\u201d \nNBC\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d chimed in with a\u00a0sketch in which Kate McKinnon played Ms. Clinton shooting the video as a selfie. A key moment in the scene occurs when her media advisor says, \u201cYou said this campaign is not about you, it\u2019s about the people. So let\u2019s try one where you don\u2019t say \u2018I\u2019 or your name.\u201d Of course, for laughs, Ms. McKinnon doesn\u2019t follow the advice. \nMaureen Dowd of The New York Times wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s a do-or-die remodeling, like when you put a new stainless steel kitchen in a house that doesn\u2019t sell.\u201d \nBut Ms. Clinton is pursuing what could prove to be a very effective strategy. It is clearly based on the adage, \u201cAll Politics Is Local,\u201d a term coined by Tip O\u2019Neill, the veteran former Speaker of the House. Local means getting close to constituents. A conversational video is as up close and personal a candidate can get to as many voters as possible. The intimacy of a close-up shot with the candidate\u2019s voice emanating from television or computer speakers creates far more empathy than multiple giant screens in an arena projecting multiple images of a candidate with a disembodied voice booming out of the speakers. \nThis is not a new strategy for Ms. Clinton. She used a video clip to announce her candidacy for the 2008 election. Her opening words then stated her intention to engage at an intimate level: \nI\u2019m not just starting a campaign, though, I\u2019m beginning a conversation \u2014 with you, with America. Because we all need to be part of the discussion if we\u2019re all going to be part of the solution. And all of us have to be part of the solution. \nIn yesterday\u2019s video announcement for the 2016 election, she doesn\u2019t even appear until a minute and a half into the two minute clip. The front end is a montage of many different ordinary Americans from all walks of life, expressing their aspirations. When she does appear, Ms. Clinton says: \nI\u2019m getting ready to do something, too, I\u2019m running for president. Americans have fought their way back from tough economic times, but the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top. Everyday Americans need a champion and I want to be that champion. So you can do more than just get by, you can get ahead and stay ahead, because when families are strong, Americans are strong. So I\u2019m hitting the road to earn your vote because it\u2019s your time. And I hope you\u2019ll join me on this journey. \nFive \u201cI\u201ds and five \u201cyou\u201ds. That verbal balance makes it more about the voters than about the candidate. The mock SNL media advisor had the right idea. And she was channeling Aristotle who, more than two millennia ago, counseled speakers to connect with their audiences on an emotional level.

Startling data from the Centers for Disease Control \u00a0shows that that prevalence of this disease, which is directly related to obesity, now exceeds 9% in the adult population. It was less than half that rate in 1996. Furthermore, there doesn\u2019t seem to be an end in sight. As the incidence of Type 2 diabetes increases, so will its sequelae: kidney failure, amputations and, eventually, heart attacks and strokes, all caused by the high levels of blood sugar endured by these patients. The increased burden to the healthcare system as a result of Type 2 diabetes will be with us for years to come. \nThe biopharmaceutical industry has recognized the need for better treatments and, as the root causes of the disease has become better understood, it has discovered and developed new classes of drugs which are improvements in helping patients bring their blood sugar under control. In fact, the FDA approved 30 new drugs to treat diabetes from 2004 \u2013 2013. The diabetes market, estimated to be over $35.6 billion in 2014, is dominated (55%) by various injectable insulins. The next biggest class of drugs in terms of sales are the DPP-IV inhibitors, such as Merck\u2019s Januvia and AstraZeneca AstraZeneca\u2019s Onglyza which make up 25% of the market. These oral agents enhance the effectiveness of a natural hormone, GLP-1, thereby enhancing insulin secretion and reducing glucose production by the liver. Other newly approved drugs include GLP-1 agonists, such as AstraZeneca\u2019s Byetta, and the latest oral agents SGLT-2 inhibitors exemplified by J&amp;J\u2019s Invokana. \nAll of these classes of drugs are linked by their ability to lower high blood sugar. However, their long-term effects are not well understood and this can be worrisome as these drugs will likely be taken by diabetics for the rest of their lives. This is not an idle concern. Long-term studies with GSK\u2019s Avandia, a member of another class of anti-diabetic agents called glitazones, actually showed that its usage elevated the risk of heart attacks and strokes. This led the FDA to restrict the use of Avandia to special circumstances, essentially resulting in this drug only being prescribed rarely. \nThe FDA has not sat idly by. In 2008, they began requiring companies to carry out long-term cardiovascular outcome studies as part of post-approval commitments. The FDA does not require that the companies show that the new drug improves heart function, but rather that it does not significantly increase the risk of heart disease since it is accepted that a new drug, by virtue of its blood sugar lowering action, will reduce the risk of diabetic complications. Long-term cardiovascular outcome studies are not trivial to conduct. They typically involve studying anywhere from 5,000 to 15,000 patients over the course of 3 \u2013 5 years at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars. However, this is the best way to get a handle on the long-term safety and efficacy of these drugs. \nThis week, the FDA will hold an Advisory Committee meeting to review outcome studies with two DPP-IV inhibitors: AstraZeneca\u2019s Onglyza and Takeda\u2019s Nesina. Of particular interest will be the discussion around Onglyza and its outcomes trial known as SAVOR. This study showed that Onglyza did not increase ischemic events. However, the rate of hospitalizations for heart failure was increased and there may be a significant increase of all-cause mortality. How concerning are these effects? Is this a class effect or solely related to Onglyza? Should this drug and other DPP-IV inhibitors carry added warnings on their labels? These are the issues that the Advisory Committee will likely address. \nThere are a number of other such studies underway for marketed diabetes drugs. The results for Merck\u2019s TECOS trial, a 14,000 patient cardiovascular study with Januvia will be reported at the American Diabetes Association American Diabetes Association in June. Furthermore, cardiovascular outcome studies now underway are not restricted to DPP-IV inhibitors nor to only oral agents. There are at least eight other trials ongoing which are exploring the long-term effects of GLP-1 agonists, SGLT-2 inhibitors and long acting insulin. All will provide important information on the value of each drug as well as drug classes to a diabetic\u2019s overall health when taking these medications.. \nIndependent of the results of this week\u2019s Advisory Committee meeting, there are those already questioning the FDA\u2019s stance on approving diabetes drugs based solely on blood sugar reduction. They espouse the view that there are already a lot of drugs on the market that lower blood sugar and that adding another, even one that acts by a totally new mechanism with great promise for reducing diabetic complications, should not be done without a full understanding of the long-term safety of the new entity. That will certainly resonate with many industry critics who feel that companies take the easiest road in order to get their drugs approved. \nHowever, requiring companies to have cardiovascular outcome studies completed before FDA approval will have a chilling effect on future diabetes R&amp;D. First of all, it will restrict the number of companies doing such research to only the biggest entities, as the cost for executing clinical trials will be probative for all but those with the largest R&amp;D budgets. Second, as these outcome studies require 3 \u2013 5 years, requiring their completion before approval will delay the availability of new, potential breakthrough diabetes drugs to patients in need. Also, the significant lengthening of the clinical program could result in a shorter patent exclusivity period which would also discourage investment. \nThe FDA is in a tough spot here. However, if it wants to encourage continued investment into diabetes R&amp;D, it would be best not to require outcome study results as a precondition for drug approval. However, once a New Drug Application has been filed with the FDA, plans for the long-term cardiovascular study should be in place and patient recruitment underway in order to minimize the time between approval and trial completion.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t", "newspaper": "Forbes", "id": 684, "pubdate": "Mon, 13 Apr 2015 19:17:00 +0530", "title": "Should The FDA Require CV Outcome Studies For Diabetes Drugs Before Approval?"}, {"content": "2013 Inman Whole Buncha Love Pinot Noir\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThink native yeasts and carbonic maceration---it might sound like a science experiment, but it\u2019s the terminology behind whole cluster fermenting.

According to Grice: \n\u201cAs link manipulation is being slowly killed by Google, there is a genuine need to reach out to real people, those who can influence in your industry. Publishers with a genuine audience are the type Google want, so reach out and engage with these \u2018real\u2019 publishers. Email and telephone will always have their place, but social is great way to connect with these publishers.\u201d \n3. Joost de Valk \nThe founder and CEO of Yoast shared some valuable insights on how to select the\u00a0perfect focus keyword for your blog post or website page. He begins by reminding us that, \u201cYour\u00a0keyword strategy\u00a0should have given you some idea what you want to write about. For blog posts, you will usually aim for a\u00a0long tail keyword\u00a0(containing multiple words).\u201d After that you can \u00a0use a tool, such as the\u00a0WP SEO plugin, to gain a list of suggestions. You also want to test the search volume of your chosen focus keyword to make sure it\u2019s high. You can do this through AdWords or Google Trends. Finally, you want to make sure that your keyword fits your audience. \n4. Joelle Gropper Kaufman \nFormer Chief Marketing Officer of Clarizen, Inc. and current head of partnerships and marketing for BloomReach, informed\u00a0Cio\u00a0that while your content needs to be \u201ccompelling, descriptive, and differentiated,\u201d you also need to look at\u00a0technical considerations, such as: \nIdentify and reduce or eliminate duplicate pages and content. \n Make sure your \u201cin-linking\u201d helps users and search engines find their way around your site. \n Identify sources of insight from within and beyond your site to guide the content you create, curate, and retain. \n Ensure your content is accessible and optimized for mobile searchers, who Kaufman says are already reaching 50 percent of search traffic. \n5.

The 2014 Midsized Business Owner\u2019s Study, which surveyed more than 750 owners and executives at companies with 50 to 999 employees, found that less than a quarter of midsized business owners are confident they have the tools and information they need to make decisions about their companies\u2019 health and benefits strategies. \nMore that two years after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality\u00a0of the ACA, over half of midsized businesses still lack plans to manage it. The steps taken by those trying to get a handle on the ACA include, cutting medical insurance costs (56 percent), offering wellness programs (46 percent), reducing the number of health plans offered (33 percent), and outsourcing benefits administration (7 percent). Additionally, the survey found that more than one-third of midsized businesses were fined or penalized for failure to comply with workforce management laws. Not surprisingly, they also reported spending more time navigating compliance with federal and state regulations. \nCompliance concerns also factor into companies\u2019 plans for global expansion. While one in 10 midsized companies plan to expand internationally in the next two years, only 23 percent felt they had the tools to manage a global workforce that is subject to a wide range of laws. For example, the survey noted that India alone has 28 states, each with its own labor laws. Additionally, increased data security concerns have yielded complex regulations regarding the handling and sharing of employee data across borders. \nWhen it comes to globalization issues, midsized business owners are unsure where to turn\u2028 for help.

According to a\u00a0recent IBM study, despite many myths, millennials have similar desires to previous generations including job security and stability. \u00a0They aren\u2019t more likely than other generations to jump-ship when they first hear of an opportunity at a friend\u2019s new start-up; But your company\u2019s junior employees do value collaboration and are the most connected generation. \u00a0So how do we create a company culture that taps into the skills of the new digital natives and engages all of us in the long-run? \nThe answer is not a better espresso machine, a weekly office happy hour or a one-time corporate-sponsored concert. \u00a0It\u2019s not even about better flexibility programs. The key is building sustainable structures to accelerate the connectedness within your company. \u00a0We need to create working environments that support day-to-day collaboration and allow junior employees to use their connectedness to enrich their work and share new ideas to solve customer or client challenges. \u00a0There are digital tools now that make it easier than ever to achieve this goal and make improvements last over the long-term. \n\n Paolo Margari on Flickr\n \nLook at\u00a0TeamedWith, an app that calls itself the first professional team networking tool. \u00a0TeamedWith allows people to get noticed in a way that is productive and fair. \u00a0According to the\u00a0IBM study, it\u2019s a myth that \u00a0\u201cmillennials want constant acclaim and think everyone on the team should get a trophy. When asked to describe their perfect boss, Millennials say they want a manager who\u2019s ethical, fair and transparent more than one who recognizes their accomplishments.\u201d \u00a0TeamedWith promotes that fairness by allowing employees to keep track of and showcase their accomplishments. \nSlack, a team communication tool, creates a better collaborative environment, consolidating information among a team so everyone has access. \u00a0There are multiple channels for files, images, projects, messages and everything is instantly searchable. \u00a0\u201cOver 125,000 people use the app every day, among them 13,000 teams at companies as large as eBay, Sony, Yelp, and NBCUniversal.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0This lessens the time spent on organizational necessities, reduces email overload and allows workers to focus more on what really excites and motivates them: expressing ideas that will impact the business. \nOther new developments like Culture Amp revolutionize the way that companies are able to collect, analyze and use employee feedback. \u00a0Rather than an internal HR department running a one-time survey or hiring expensive outside consultants which might take months to analyze data, Culture Amp offers an online platform so HR departments can prepare surveys that get at the heart of issues most important to employees and then quickly provides actionable insights. The important thing is not a one-time crowdsourcing competition but ongoing communication that allows employees to meaningfully express themselves and enables executives to respond quickly and test new ideas. Uber, Pandora Pandora, Airbnb and Warby Parker\u00a0have already signed up for Culture Amp. \u00a0Some companies do monthly Culture Amp surveys to help with quarterly objectives while others use it every few weeks to keep a detailed look on how employees are doing over time. \nAnother way to build a positive company culture, is to encourage employees to seek mentorship and expand their professional networks. With new digital tools, like\u00a0Betterup, companies don\u2019t have to invest the time and money solely on matchmaking junior employees with more senior mentors internally. \u00a0Betterup provides inexpensive executive coaching to anyone and everyone. \u00a0The app combines research from behavioral scientists, psychologists, health experts, Navy SEALs, Olympic medalists, and executives. \u00a0According to its description, \u201cmillennials are the most stressed generation and are not receiving the support they want. Over 75% of Millennials wish their manager was more of a coach. They are seeking coaching that\u2019s evidence-based, affordable, and optimized for their busy, on-the-go lifestyle.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tPage 1 / 2\n\n\t\t\t\tContinue \n\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t", "newspaper": "Forbes", "id": 692, "pubdate": "Mon, 13 Apr 2015 18:55:00 +0530", "title": "How To Engage Millennials In Your Corporate Culture"}, {"content": "\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nIt\u2019s always curious to me that when it comes to investing, far too many look at this process like the weather. \nIf they think the forecast or present day will be unpleasant, they avoid the stock market and go to cash, which is paying nothing.

When Walt Disney did a similar trick for one of their\u00a0Avengers: Age of Ultron\u00a0trailers on a weekday afternoon, that puppy went from 0% to 100% in about an hour. Now granted Paramount/Viacom Inc. decided to do this on a Sunday night starting at around 3pm PST while I would imagine quite a few fantasy fans were eventually got up with\u00a0watching\u00a0The MTV Movie Awards,\u00a0Game of Thrones,\u00a0Mad Men, and whatever else constitutes the \u201cbest shows on television\u201d at the moment (I\u2019ll catch up on Mad Men\u00a0and\u00a0VEEP\u00a0later this week). Nonetheless, when you do a gimmick that is based on showing how excited fans are to see the new trailer and then that trailer just sits there, unlocked all night and straight through the morning, that percentage meter barely budging, well, maybe they should have just dropped the thing on Monday morning. Which is now what they have done,\u00a0fourteen hours after the fact. \nBut now this new trailer drops just minutes after the debut of Walt Disney\u2019s\u00a0Ant Man\u00a0trailer and on top of likely new looks at the likes of\u00a0\u00a0Jurassic World, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, and maybe even\u00a0Pan\u00a0over the next week or so. By the way, I apologize in advance if the next seven days involve a lot of trailer essays. I\u2019ll try to make sure that\u2019s \u201cin addition to\u201d my regular content, but nonetheless, there are going to be a lot worth discussing in the run-up to\u00a0Avengers: Age of Ultron. Anyway, as I\u2019ve said before here and there, I\u2019m actually halfway curious concerning Terminator: Genisys. It\u2019s a project that seems to be the product of the most base kind of franchise cynicism, yet the filmmakers are going about it in the most difficult fashion imaginable. \nAlan Taylor and friends could have just done a straight reboot/remake of the original time traveling robot chase thriller, or they could have done a straight sequel set somewhere in the timeline. But instead, they are doing a somewhat nutty in-between concept. It\u2019s basically the same continuity as the first film, just rejiggered via time travel and Chaos Theory and all. The end result seems to be that we\u2019re seeing many of the iconic events of the first two (three?) films in the franchise from a slightly different point-of-view, in a\u00a0Back to the Future II kinda way. It will surely infuriate the purists, and I imagine general audiences won\u2019t necessarily appreciate the bass-ackwards reimagining of the earlier films\u2019 plot beats and character relationships, so you run the risk of making no one happy. Which is why I frankly don\u2019t get why this trailer saw fit to spoil what would have been two massive surprises (one at around 90 seconds and one right at the end) for the hardcore fans. It won\u2019t mean anything to the general moviegoers but fans would have preferred to discover said turns and/or revelations in the movie. \nAs much as I detest the idea of going back to the Terminator\u00a0well because\u00a0Terminator 2\u00a0and\u00a0Terminator 3\u00a0were really big hits in their day, I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t intrigued by how Skydance and friends have gone about it. It may be a disaster, but they aren\u2019t being lazy. As much as we nerds hem-and-haw about whether or not there needs to be another Terminator\u00a0film or whether or not it\u2019s \u201chonoring\u201d the first two James Cameron films, the general audiences are merely going to see what looks like an incredibly expensive and action-packed science fiction action adventure film. Yes, Terminator 2: Judgment Day\u00a0earned $519 million worldwide in 1991 when that was enough to make it the the third-biggest grossing movie of all time worldwide (behind\u00a0E.T.\u00a0and\u00a0Star Wars). And yes, Jonathan Mostow\u2019s underrated\u00a0Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines\u00a0earned $433m back in 2003 which is still one of the biggest-grossing R-rated movies of all time even twelve years later. \nSo now the $175m question is whether or not Arnold Schwarzenegger playing a Terminator is the kind of star+character combination that yields massive box office results from both general audiences and hardcore fans, or whether those two\u00a0Terminator\u00a0sequels were merely of their time. Also of note, if\u00a0Terminator: Genisys really \u201cstars\u201d Emilia Clarke as Sarah Connor as the prime action figure/lead character of the piece, then that makes the (as of this writing) $175 million-budgeted\u00a0Terminator Genisys\u00a0one of\u00a0the most expensive movie of all time with a female lead (Maleficent\u00a0cost around $180m and\u00a0Alice in Wonderland\u00a0cost $200m) and certainly the most expensive female-driven action movie of all time. That will be an interesting bit of trivia if all of this comes to pass. Come what may,\u00a0Terminator: Genisys opens on July 1st, 2015 courtesy of Paramount.

Yum\u2019s newest China restaurant brand, Atto Primo, is situated in the heart of the Shanghai Bund, home to some of the city\u2019s oldest and most famous buildings and most expensive restaurants. Yum is calling the restaurant a \u201clab\u201d for now, but I suspect it could quickly expand the concept with new outlets if it proves popular. \nOnline sources indicate that Atto Primo is still in its testing phases, and descriptions and photos depict and restaurant that\u2019s decidedly upscale with high but not meteoric prices\u00a0 starting at 300 yuan ($50) per person. The photos show a place with lots of wood and tile decor. The atmosphere looks comfortable but also a bit confused on whether this is a place for adults or families, which could lead to some branding problems if people come expecting one or the other but not both. \nThe Yum name and its stable of mid- to low-end brands, including KFC, Pizza Hut and a few local chains, is nowhere in the new restaurant or its literature, which isn\u2019t too surprising due to the huge difference in target audiences. Yum\u2019s only mention of the chain at all comes in a US regulatory filing, according to one report on the new roll-out. (English article) \nThis particular roll-out is part of Yum\u2019s broader effort to reinvigorate its tired stable of brands, that have become somewhat passe in China and have also been tainted by several food safety scandals. A big part of the reboot involves a bid to move upscale, reflecting the very real fact that average Chinese consumers now have far more income than when Yum first entered the market with its landmark KFC store at Tiananmen Square in 1987. \n\n A woman looks at a menu with words \u201d everyday half-price \u201d in front of a KFC fast food restaurant in Beijing, China Thursday, July 31, 2014. Global fast food chains are rushing to expand in China but even experienced operators face costly pitfalls in a fast-changing food supply industry plagued by repeated safety scandals. (AP Photo/Andy Wong)\n \nYum detailed its KFC relaunch plan about a year ago, which included a broader \u201cdining room\u201d concept aimed at making the new restaurants feel more like a home rather than a place to eat quickly and go. (previous post) It made the announcement as its KFC same-store sales were declining after years of breakneck growth, as Chinese consumers abandoned the chain. Last month new Yum CEO Greg Creed said that turning around Yum\u2019s flagging China performance was his first, second and third top priorities. \nI seldom go to KFC anymore, and am probably indicative of what\u2019s happening among the broader Chinese population. I personally find the food quite greasy, and the atmosphere noisy and not conducive to enjoying a pleasant meal. Nothing about the stores and their food has really changed that much these last 20 years, which perhaps is part of the problem. The bigger challenge confronting Yum right now is the rise of many other eating options with better food and atmosphere at comparable prices. \nIn an effort to see how the refresh campaign is going, I visited 3 KFCs near the university where I teach to see if anything was different. All 3 had new premium coffee counters, as part of a move announced early this year to pursue the kinds of yuppies who frequent Starbucks and McDonald\u2019s in-store McCafes. (previous post) Other than that, all 3 stores had brighter signage emphasizing fresh and healthy ingredients. Only one had wi-fi, and only one had a newer seating format that emphasized more space and comfort from the older, more cramped and basic seating layouts. \nThese steps certainly seem like positive moves to win back customers, though they may be too little too late, especially in the premium coffee segment that has recently become quite crowded. I do like the Atto Primo concept a bit more, as it really does cater to a growing demand from many Chinese for a more pleasant and upscale eating experience. I imagine Yum will tinker with the brand for a year or so before deciding whether to expand it to elsewhere in China. \nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s encouraging to see that Yum is finally taking some very concrete actions to try and reverse its slide in China, its largest market for both revenue and profits. But that said, I\u2019m still not convinced the changes at KFC will be enough to win back consumers who see the brand as tired and past its prime. Same-store sales at Yum\u2019s 7,000 China restaurants sagged 16 percent in the last quarter, partly due to a food safety scandal that broke in the middle of last year. It\u2019s still trying to recover from that setback, and could face a difficult time getting back into positive growth territory for the first half of this year. \nDoug Young is a former China company news chief for Reuters who teaches financial journalism at Fudan University in Shanghai.

And that does not include the funds that went out of business because of poor performance. &#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  While some of the banks have seen better performance over more recent periods \u2014 in which the stock markets have been steadily rising \u2014 the investment products created by Wall Street's biggest name, Goldman, have been particularly disappointing, with only 12 percent of the bank's mutual funds outperforming their relative benchmarks over the last 10 years, and 35 percent over the last five years. &#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \"It's a good business for them \u2014 but that doesn't mean it is a good investment,\" said Larry Swedroe, director of research at Buckingham Asset Management. Mr. Swedroe began his career on bank trading desks but has become an advocate for more passive investment strategies. &#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  There is a wide body of research showing how hard it is for actively managed mutual funds \u2014 like the ones run by the banks \u2014 to outperform low-cost funds like the ones that invest in a benchmarked index of stocks and bonds. &#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  The banks have suggested in marketing materials that their investing prowess differentiates their offerings from the pack. But the relatively high fees that banks charge for their mutual funds subtract from the ultimate returns and make it harder to compete against their most successful competitor in recent years, the giant fund manager Vanguard, a company that prides itself on offering low-cost funds. &#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  Thanks in large part to its low fees, 80 percent of Vanguard's actively managed funds survived and outperformed a majority of peers during the last 10 years. At Goldman, only 24 percent did so, and only 30 percent of Wells Fargo funds did. &#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  A Morningstar analyst for Goldman funds, Laura Lallos, said, \"We do not consider their overall long-term performance to be a success any way you look at it.\" &#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  The underwhelming performance of most funds is rarely mentioned when the banks discuss the big business opportunity they are going after in the so-called asset management sector. &#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  When Goldman's chief financial officer, Harvey M. Schwartz, spoke about Goldman's \"strategic initiative to grow asset management\" on his most recent call with investors, he said that the \"team's done a great job.\" &#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  For Goldman's bottom line, the business has indeed been doing well. During 2014, the company's funds drew $73 billion of new money from investors, increasing revenues in the investment management division by 11 percent over the previous year. Goldman has nearly doubled the number of mutual funds it has offered over the last decade. &#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  When Goldman and other banks discuss the performance of their funds, they tend to use statistics that are weighted by how much money is in each of the funds at the time of measurement. On this basis, Goldman says that 75 percent of its clients' money is in mutual funds that have been in the top half of competitors over the last five years. &#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \"There are many ways to determine the performance of mutual funds, but we choose to consistently focus on figures that we believe most accurately reflect the investment performance that our clients experience,\" said David Wells, a Goldman spokesman. &#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  Darin Oduyoye, a spokesman for JPMorgan, says that it, too, chooses to look at fund performance based on where client money is at the current moment. He said that looking at the absolute number of funds that have underperformed is \"misleading and does not reflect where our clients are actually invested.\" &#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  The approach used by the banks, though, is not favored by researchers because it skews the figures to where money is now, even if the money just entered top-performing funds and did not experience recent gains. Studies have shown that investors tend to put money into investments after periods of outperformance and then miss that outperformance. &#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have acknowledged that their funds, broadly, have not been stellar in the past, but both companies have recently made big efforts to reshape their teams and improve the returns. That has helped increase the number of funds at both companies that have beaten their benchmarks over the last three and five years, though the outperformance slipped again during the last year.&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  Read More Money Funds Remain Haunted by Fears of 'Breaking the Buck'Read MoreBlackstone's Deal With G.E.

An investor, for example, who put $10,000 into Goldman's mutual fund for medium-size companies, with the ticker GCMAX \u2014 one of the most popular Goldman funds among ordinary investors \u2014 would pay around $1,143 in fees over five years, including a $500 upfront fee. That is about 10 times what it would have cost if the money had been in a comparable fund at Vanguard, even though the Goldman fund would have led to returns that were 6 percent lower than the Vanguard fund over the last five years. &#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  Wall Street has a long and troubled history of moving into, and out of, the mutual fund business. In the 1990s, many of the big banks built up large families of mutual fund families that they marketed to clients of their brokerage divisions. &#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  In the decade that followed, though, several banks faced investigations and fines for encouraging their brokers to sell the bank's proprietary investment products even when they underperformed funds provided by outside companies. This was one of the factors that led Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, which is now a part of Bank of America, to sell off their mutual fund operations in 2005 and 2006. &#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  Today, the banks that kept their mutual fund businesses continue to offer those funds through their in-house brokers and advisers. All the banks have said that they do not rely heavily on selling their funds to in-house clients, but none of them provide data on how common it is. &#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  JPMorgan Chase is currently facing an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission on accusations that it encouraged its brokers to sell the company's proprietary mutual funds even when they underperformed competitors. &#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  JPMorgan has, on the whole, had more success than the other big banks in running mutual funds. &#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  Over the last five years, 58 percent of its mutual funds beat their benchmarks, and 53 percent over the last year. &#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t&#13;\n\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  The banks have occasionally acknowledged the difficulty that their mutual funds have in outperforming lower-cost alternatives that passively invest in an index of stocks or bonds.

The pair are a good fit in terms of products and geographies, and bulking up would help them cut costs as they try to compete with mobile market leader Sweden's Ericsson (ERICb.ST) and low-cost powerhouse China's Huawei [HWT.UL]. Nokia would expand its presence in the key United States market where Alcatel-Lucent is a major supplier to operators AT&amp;T (T.N) and Verizon (VZ.N), and get access to the French firm's fast-growing, profitable Internet routing business. But the track record of mergers in the industry is spotty, in part because of the difficulties of cutting costs in a R&amp;D intensive business where companies cannot simply drop products that global telecom operators rely on. The last round, which gave birth to Alcatel-Lucent and combined Nokia's networks business with Siemens about a decade ago, saw both firms lose value and market share as rivals went on the attack while they were busy integrating the businesses. The French government, which has a record of intervening in major takeover deals and is sensitive about job cuts and keeping a French foothold in strategic industries, publicly backed the plan.

Here we have these listed companies going to talk to France\u2019s president,\" said Juha Varis of Danske Capital.\u201cThis is an industry with not much growth in sight, so there\u2019s no question the combined company must cut costs\u2026 The companies should be allowed to do exactly what they want without restrictions from any state.\u201dA statement from a group of unions said meetings would take place with management on Friday.   The companies' joint statement came in reaction to media reports that the two had revived tie-up talks that have been on and off for years in an industry that is seen by investors and sector executives as in need of further consolidation.Nokia buying Alcatel-Lucent would transform the competitive dynamics in the telecom equipment industry, which has already been through a long price war sparked by the rise of low-cost Chinese players Huawei and smaller cousin ZTE Corp. For Nokia, the deal would be a step to growing again. It sold its flagship handset business to Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) last year after mishandling the move to smartphones and being left behind by Apple and Samsung.Forty-seven-year-old Nokia chief Suri, born in India, has been hailed for turning Nokia\u2019s network unit profitable through drastic cost-cuts, and has repeatedly said further consolidation in the industry is inevitable but that any large deal must be \u201cwisely thought-out\u201d.In wireless, the combined group would have market share of 35 percent, compared with 40 percent for Ericsson and 20 percent for Huawei, according to Bernstein Research.Clairinvest fund manager Ion-Marc Valahu expressed scepticism over the merits of the proposed deal.\"They could come up with some cost cuts, but just because you combine one weak player with another weak player does not necessarily mean that you will end up with a stronger player.\"The combined company would have sales of around 26 billion euros, compared with 24.4 billion for Ericsson last year and 37.44 billion for Huawei, which also sells handsets so is not an exact comparison.Asked on Tuesday for reaction to the deal news, Ericsson Chief Executive Hans Vestberg said companies in the sector were all searching for scale but added he did not foresee an immediate challenge to his strategy.\"I will, together with management, evaluate everything that this might mean,\" he said.A counterbid for Alcatel-Lucent is seen by analysts as unlikely since Ericsson would run into antitrust problems if it got bigger, and Huawei would face strong political opposition in France and the United States where Alcatel-Lucent is a major supplier to operators AT&amp;T and Verizon.JP Morgan is advising Nokia, and boutique investment bank Zaoui &amp; Co is working for Alcatel-Lucent, said a person familiar with the matter.($1 = 0.9489 euros) (Additional reporting by Sven Nordenstam in Stockholm, Andrew Callus, Matthieu Protard and Jean Baptiste Vey in Paris and Sudip Kar-Gupta and Sophie Sassard in London; Editing by Sophie Walker and Philippa Fletcher)", "newspaper": "Reuters", "id": 724, "pubdate": "Tue, 14 Apr 2015 21:05:29 +0530", "title": "Nokia in talks to buy Alcatel-Lucent; France backs deal"}, {"content": "\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Embattled BNY Mellon Corp (BK.N) CEO Gerald Hassell, under fire from activist investors, received a public rebuke on Tuesday at the bank's annual meeting for lagging past performance, but also a vote of support to make improvements going forward.\nThe words of criticism and support came from Ed Garden, who joined BNY Mellon's board in December. Garden is a senior executive at Trian Fund Management LP, the activist hedge fund run by billionaire Nelson Peltz that owns about 2.6 percent of BNY Mellon's stock.\"Nobody is satisfied with past performance,\" Garden said toward the end of the hour-long annual meeting in New York City. But at the same time, Garden said the bank's board supports Hassell and his management team, though they will be held accountable for meeting the financial targets they've laid out.Hassell, who became CEO in 2011, has been criticized by investors and analysts for missing key targets, such as profit forecasts. Earlier this month, activist hedge fund Marcato Capital Management said BNY Mellon's employee base is \"bloated\" and disproportionately larger than its rivals. Marcato said the bank has 10,000 excess employees. \"We know there are things we have to do better,\" Hassell said. About 40 people, not including board members and senior executives, attended the annual meeting, which also was webcast. Annual meetings tended to be scripted events, but Hassell patiently fielded several pointed questions from outspoken banking analyst Mike Mayo of CLSA.Mayo, for example, asked Hassell why it has taken so long to reduce the number of custody platforms at the world's largest custody bank. Hassell said the bank now has two custody platforms, down from four, and he expects to only have one by this time next year. Mayo also asked why the bank has lost market share in its core custody business. \"It's slipped a little bit. I'll admit to that,\" Hassell said. But he added the bank has been more selective in adding clients, to ensure the business is profitable.Hassell has made a number of moves to streamline the bank's operations, such as selling its headquarters and its corporate trust units in Japan and Mexico. Garden joined Hassell in offering an upbeat outlook for the bank.\"We're going to be a force to be reckoned with in everything we do,\" Garden said.

Labor disruptions at normally busy West Coast ports, a stronger dollar and softer global demand also have hurt growth.\"A rebound in retail sales in March provides evidence that the U.S. economy is pulling out of a soft patch seen at the start of the year. The improvement in retail sales ... adds to the likelihood of policymakers voting to hike rates this year,\" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit in London.Retail sales increased 0.9 percent in March. That was the largest gain since the same month last year and snapped three straight months of declines that had been blamed on harsh winter weather.U.S. stocks were trading lower as unexpectedly strong earnings from banking giants JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) and Wells Fargo &amp; Co (WFC.N) were offset by Johnson &amp; Johnson's (JNJ.N) announcement that it was cutting its full-year earnings forecast due to the impact of the buoyant dollar.Prices for U.S. government debt rose, while the dollar was weaker against a basket of currencies.Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services rose 0.3 percent after dropping 0.2 percent in February. The so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. Economists shrugged of the mild rebound and said it reflected the lingering effects of cold weather. With savings at their highest level in just over two years, thanks to a tightening labor market and cheaper gasoline, there is great potential for consumers to boost spending in the months ahead and cushion the economy against the strong dollar.Data on trade, consumer spending, manufacturing and home building have suggested the economy grew at a sub-1.5 percent annual rate in the first quarter.But economists could raise their estimates in the wake of a second report on Tuesday from the Commerce Department, which showed retail inventories excluding automobiles rose 0.5 percent in February after gaining 0.2 percent in the prior month.AUTO SALES SURGEIn a separate report, the Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand increased 0.2 percent last month, with rising prices for goods accounting for more than half of the increase. The PPI had declined 0.5 percent in February.In the 12 months through March, producer prices fell 0.8 percent, the biggest year-on-year decline since the revamped series started in 2009, after sliding 0.6 percent in February.Low inflation and signs of a sharp slowdown in economic growth in the first quarter have prompted most economists to push back their expectations for the first Fed rate hike to either September or October from June. Others believe the U.S. central bank will only tighten monetary policy in 2016.The Fed, which has a 2 percent inflation target, has kept its key short-term interest rate near zero since December 2008. A key measure of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services rose 0.2 percent after being unchanged in February. Core PPI was up 0.8 percent in the 12 months through March.Retail sales last month were buoyed by a 2.7 percent rise in automobile sales, the biggest increase since March 2014. Sales at clothing stores increased 1.2 percent. Receipts at building material and garden equipment stores advanced 2.1 percent, the largest rise since July 2013. There were also increases in sales at furniture stores, restaurants and bars, and sporting goods and hobby shops. However, sales at electronics and appliance stores slipped as did receipts at online stores.

But he highlighted the difficulties some jurisdictions face when they issue debt to finance operating deficits, and when they under-fund public pensions.In Chicago, for example, unfunded pension liabilities for the city, the board of education and other local governments that draw taxes from it exceed $35 billion, according to the Civic Federation, an independent fiscal watchdog.The city, which received a warning last week from ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's, has $8.3 billion in general obligation bond debt and frequently uses debt to close budget shortfalls.Puerto Rico, meanwhile, is struggling with more than $70 billion in total debt and must overcome opposition from local lawmakers as well as demands from investors for extra security as it attempts to sell more debt.Dudley said borrowing to pay off a current year operating deficit is inconsistent with running a balanced budget, leaves the municipality with no new asset, and is \"equivalent to asking future taxpayers to help finance today's public services.\"Unfunded pension liabilities are estimated to be as high as several trillion dollars, Dudley said. \"At a certain point, the debt service burden clashes with maintaining a sufficient ongoing provision of services to forestall people from voting with their feet,\" he said. \"This may occur well before the point that debt service capacity appears to be fully exhausted,\" Dudley added. \"In other words, the prioritization of cash flows to debt service may not be sustainable beyond a certain point.\" (Additional reporting by Dan Burns; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)", "newspaper": "Reuters", "id": 729, "pubdate": "Tue, 14 Apr 2015 19:45:18 +0530", "title": "Detroit, Stockton bankruptcies may flag wider problems: Fed's Dudley"}, {"content": "\n\nDETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. safety regulators have opened an investigation into Subaru Impreza sedans from model year 2012 because the front passenger seat air bags may fail to operate.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in documents posted online on Tuesday that it had received 26 vehicle owner questionnaires involving the Imprezas' occupant detection system failing to operate or incorrectly turning off the front passenger air bag when the seat is occupied, which could increase the risk of injury in an accident.

He was quoted on Monday as saying a 105 yen rate was acceptable, but sought on Tuesday to clarify that he had been referring to the purchasing power parity-implied rate, which is around 101 yen, not the spot market rate.\"If the PPP-implied rate is at 105 yen and the yen weakens to 125 yen or to 130 yen, then such a gap may invite speculators,\" Hamada said.The yen fell on the comments, giving up some of its gains on his previous remarks.

The central bank maintained its massive stimulus program last week and brushed aside speculation of near-term additional easing, even as inflation grinds to a halt far below the bank's targeted 2 percent.Hamada said \"core-core\" CPI, which excludes energy and food prices, of around 1 percent would be reasonable. The latest data showed it was 0.3 percent in February, after stripping out the effect of last year's sales-tax hike.If the BOJ should ease policy, a further short-term weakening \"cannot be helped,\" Hamada said, adding that in that case, Japan could not be accused of engaging in a \"currency war\" or competitive valuation, as long as monetary policy was aimed at boosting the domestic economy, rather than targeting the exchange rate.

Swiss group Holcim needs the backing of two thirds of its shareholders at the meeting on May 8 to approve a capital increase to fund the deal.   \"Eurocement's chairman, Filaret Galchev, is not part of the foreseen board, which would have reduced the risk of his voting against the merger,\" Vontobel analyst Christian Arnold wrote in a note. Arnold has a \"buy\" rating on Holcim's stock. Eurocement did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Holcim's chairman said last month that the company was open to giving Galchev a seat on the combined board but his name was not on Tuesday's list of candidates.A Eurocement source told Reuters at the time that a seat on the board would be of interest but that Galchev is still seeking further improvement to the deal's exchange ratio of nine Holcim shares for 10 Lafarge shares. The designated board of directors will consist of 14 members to be elected at Holcim's extraordinary general meeting on May 8. Each company will receive seven seats, with Holcim Chairman Wolfgang Reitzle and Lafarge Chief Executive Bruno Lafont proposed as co-chairmen of the merged company. Current Holcim board member Thomas Schmidheiny, the company's biggest shareholder with a stake of about 20 percent, is also among the candidates for a seat on the new board. Lafarge and Holcim last week picked Lafarge insider Eric Olsen as chief executive of the combined company. The CEO role was a major sticking point when the tie-up came close to collapse last month.

This has\u00a0 prompted criticism from companies, already grappling with unpredictable demand and a lack of alternative funding sources. The stock market has soared, touching record highs last month. It was Asia\u2019s second-best performer last year, thanks to largely $16 billion of foreign investment.But the boom has failed to translate into many IPOs, a vital source of capital, especially for small companies which make up the bulk of the economy yet often struggle to access keenly priced bank loans.Money raised from public offerings has dropped from a peak of $8.47 billion in 2010 to just over $250 million so far this year, according to Thomson Reuters Data.Investor demand has been lukewarm, and India has seen lacklustre debuts in 2015. Private equity firms, key drivers of the market, have also struggled to exit through listings that would in many cases crystallise losses. But some bankers and companies say delays in the review of listing documents by Sebi are complicating the listing process, jeopardising billions of dollars of extra liquidity for Indian shares.\u201cGetting an approval takes a lot of time, and after that, unless you have four or five merchant bankers willing to underwrite the whole issue, it becomes very difficult to raise money,\u201d said Nevil Savjani, vice-president at boutique merchant banker Corporate Strategic Allianz Ltd.Savjani advised edible oil producer NCML Industries on a $10 million listing that was shelved in January. Sebi took 18 months to approve that prospectus. \u201cSebi's guideline is that they approve it within 30 days, after an in-principle nod from the stock exchanges. But generally, if you look at any of the IPOs it takes it at least one year.\u201dThe time regulators take to approve listing prospectuses can vary, depending on everything from the quality of the document to the amount of IPOs in the pipeline. But Hong Kong, for example, typically takes a month or two, and no longer than six months.Documents withdrawn or lapsed&#13;\nA Sebi spokesman did not comment on market participants' complaints that it was slow to approve IPOs.But officials said privately that the regulator was under pressure to avoid failures that could burn India's army of retail investors, stretching already limited resources.It also wants to prevent a repeat of cases like property developer DLF, penalised by Sebi last year for disclosure problems around its record 2007 listing. The penalty was overturned on appeal.Close to 700 billion rupees ($11.2 billion) of approved offer documents have either been withdrawn or lapsed in the last five years, according to a SEBI official who declined to be named.Inox Wind Ltd, an alternative energy firm which began trading this month, had to wait for a year before its listing plans were approved. Its bankers, awaiting a favourable moment, took another eight months to get the shares to market.\"They (Sebi) have been ... very slow and that's been a trend with the entire bureaucratic process in India,\" said Devansh Jain, a director of Inox Wind.For a handful of larger companies, the alternative is to raise cash abroad.Satellite TV company Videocon d2h withdrew its pending IPO prospectus last month after waiting for two years to go public. Instead it listed on the Nasdaq through a reverse takeover.For small firms the problem is tougher. Many are struggling to raise affordable funding from banks, themselves battling with hefty piles of soured loans. Sebi has long struggled with balancing the needs of small investors and those of the market.In 2012, Sebi considered making it mandatory for underwriters to buy back shares from retail investors if a company's shares fell below the IPO price.

For investors who love the risk-reward profile of tier-II and III stocks in various sectors, the last financial year was one of the best.The BSE small-cap index is up 58.7 per cent in the past 12 months, about three times the rise in the Sensex and the Nifty during the same period. The BSE mid-cap index rallied 52 per cent, outshining its bigger peers. On a trailing price-to-earnings multiple, both the indices are more expensive than the benchmark.\u201cThis is typical of a bull-run. In 2007 and 2008, small- and mid-caps were trading at a 40 per cent premium to large-caps but it was corrected subsequently,\u201d says Pankaj Murarka, head (equity), Axis Mutual Fund.By contrast, some of India\u2019s biggest companies, such as Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), Cairn India, ONGC, Tata Motors, Gail, NMDC, Sesa Sterlite and NTPC, are among the cheapest stocks in the market currently. RIL\u2019s valuation ratio, for instance, is at its lowest in about a decade, while Cairn India is trading 50 per cent higher than during its initial public offering in 2006.This has created a valuation gap between large-cap stocks and their small- and mid-cap peers. For example, ITC, one of the top-performing fast-moving consumer goods stocks in the past decade, is now the cheapest stock in the segment, with a 12-month trailing price-to-earnings multiple of 35.8, while those for Hindustan Unilever and Gillette India are 56.1 and 199, respectively.In the automobile segment, Tata Motors and Bajaj Auto are two of the cheapest stocks, trading at a fraction of the valuation ratios of Eicher Motors and Atul Auto, a Gujarat-based three-wheeler maker focused on the rural and semi-urban markets in north, west and east India.In the cement segment, small regional players such as JK Lakshmi Cement, Ramco Cement and Shree Cement have richer valuations than those of their national peers such as ACC, Ultratech Cement and Ambuja Cement.The same is true for the financial services and banking segments. Mortgage company Housing Development and Finance Corporation has a lower valuation ratio than entrants such as Repco Home Finance and its own subsidiary, Gruh Finance, too. In the private sector banking sector, HDFC Bank is trading at a lower price-to-earnings multiple than Kotak Mahindra Bank and has barely managed to maintain a premium over IndusInd Bank.Some fund managers are worried, saying valuation comfort is declining in mid-caps. \u201cIt\u2019s not a bubble yet but there is froth in many mid-and small-cap counters. I would advise investors to be cautious about any incremental investment in mid-caps and small-caps,\u201d says Murarka.At such high valuations, small- and mid-caps stocks could come under heavy selling pressure if the market turns choppy due to poor corporate earnings or global shocks such as a rate rise by the US Federal Reserve. \u201cWhen stocks correct from such high valuations, it might take years for investors to recoup their losses, as had happened to many mid-caps in the previous bull-run. I advise investors to stay way from mid-caps and play a recovery story through large-caps,\u201d says G Chokkalingam, founder and chief executive of Equinomics Research &amp; Advisory.Experts say large-cap stocks provide good downside protection and these are likely to be resilient during a downturn.\u201cThough the bull-run is here to stay, the direction of the market through the next six months is uncertain, given so many domestic and global events on the horizon. In this scenario, large-caps provide a better risk-reward ratio than richly valued small- and mid-caps,\u201d says Chokkalingam.Others sense market manipulation in many of these mid-cap counters. \u201cMost of these richly valued stocks have small free-float (non-promoter shareholding) and most of it has been cornered by operators. Now, they get whatever price they want; it has nothing to do with the company\u2019s fundamentals,\u201d says an analyst.", "newspaper": "Business Standard", "id": 740, "pubdate": "Tue, 14 Apr 2015 22:01:00 +0530", "title": "Many large-caps are now the cheapest stocks"}, {"content": "&#13;\n         &#13;\n    &#13;\nThe northeast region remains neglected by the country\u2019s Rs 12 lakh-crore mutual fund sector.&#13;\nThe northeast region remains neglected by the country\u2019s Rs 12 lakh-crore mutual fund sector.Only 34 of 1,606 MF branches are in these eight states.

There are various other issues such as a weak underlying economy and insurgency. More, expansion is a commercial call. Unless it is profitable, why would players go and expand?\u201d\u201cPrimarily, it's the inaccessibility of the northeast states which should be blamed, whether you look at the road or rail connectivity or air flights. Over and above, the continuous fear about insurgency makes it challenging to do business in these regions,\u201d said a senior official with a fund house.He said Assam was better covered as the state is relatively easier to access.&#13;\n&#13;\n\tMay be that Modi's special attention for the northeast can give lift the sentiments.

As a result, the promoters shareholding in the company has come down to 29.41 per cent from 48.33 per cent prior.

However, the KPA has estimated Arabica production at much lower level of below 70,000 tonnes due to widespread attack of White Stem Borer (WSB) pest across the growing regions in Karnataka. Karnataka accounts for 70% of national bean output.The harvest for the 2014-15 season has been completed and the planters\u2019 body has estimated the production at little over 300,000 tonnes.

Thus, a decline in BR would not impact NIMs.\u201dCRISIL Research expects NIMs to improve slightly in 2015-16, backed by a gradual economic recovery and an improving proportion of retail loans, which have higher yields, he says.Last week, State Bank of India (SBI), ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank cut their BRs by 15-25 basis points (bps), after the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s monetary policy review. On Monday, Kotak Mahindra, the fourth largest private bank, cut its BR by 15 bps, to 9.85 per cent. Other banks are likely to follow.Experts believe these cuts were long overdue, as RBI has cut rates by 50 bps in 2015 so far. However, there could be some pressure on interest\u00a0 income of banks. SBI officials estimate a Rs 1,200-1,300 crore hit on interest income due to the 15 bps cut in BR. However, analysts say the impact on profit will be limited. They believe SBI could witness a four or five bps NIM impact; for ICICI Bank, the hit could be of five-six bps. With HDFC Bank, the impact is expected to be negligible, as a relatively low (20 per cent) proportion of its loan book is linked to the BR. In ICICI and SBI, this ratio is 50 per cent and 80 per cent, respectively. However, NIM movement is not contingent only on rates and is determined by other key factors such as credit costs, too. There are other factors that will have a bigger bearing on banks' profitability. This includes other income, expected to be robust, and a possible increase in credit costs in the near term.\u00a0 Credit costs pertain to the amounts set aside by banks for non-performing assets (NPAs) and restructured loans.Vaibhav Agrawal, vice-president, research\u2013banking, Angel Broking, says bank NIMs should improve in the March quarter due to a three to four bps savings in cost of funds. He believes the quarter would have the full impact of DR cuts and, hence, might aid NIMs. However, higher credit costs on account of increased NPAs could offset these to some extent.IDBI Bank executives, too, indicate that when clubbed with credit costs, the NIM impact will be more pronounced. Thus, banks, especially from the public sector, which have much higher credit costs will witness higher margin contraction. The actual impact will vary from one lender to another.\u201cWe believe bank-specific NIMs would vary quite meaningfully. Historical margin profiles show the movement of bank-specific margins in an easing/tightening cycle are dependent on other factors as well, such as the share of fixed rate loans, share of wholesale deposits and changing asset-liability profile\u201d, analysts at Ambit Capital write in a recent report.They believe IndusInd Bank is best placed to protect its margins due to its high fixed rate portfolio, higher share of floating rate liabilities and improving liabilities.But, if banks cut BRs aggressively, the impact on their NIMs could be more prominent, which some analysts believe is a possibility.Adarsh Parasrampuria of Nomura says, \u201cGiven that banks have cut DRs by 25-50 bps in the past six to nine months, we would expect them to now accelerate the BR cuts. This will have a negative impact on bank margins, especially for public sector ones, in the interim. We believe bank margins, especially for corporate/PSU banks, will be negatively impacted, due to faster transmission in a falling rate environment. The impact on retail private banks will be lower, as 40-50 per cent of the loan book is fixed in nature.\u201d", "newspaper": "Business Standard", "id": 752, "pubdate": "Mon, 13 Apr 2015 22:49:00 +0530", "title": "Base rate cuts to have limited impact on bank margins: Analysts"}, {"content": "&#13;\n         &#13;\n    &#13;\nReliance Industries Ltd (RIL)\u2019s share price has seen a sharp jump this month, buoyed by a string of positive recommendations by broking houses.&#13;\nReliance Industries Ltd (RIL)\u2019s share price has seen a sharp jump this month, buoyed by a string of positive recommendations by broking houses.The stock has gained around 12 per cent this month, outperforming the benchmark BSE Sensex, which is up nearly six per cent.

The survey projected that if Lok Sabha elections were held this year, the BJP would win less seats than it did in April/May 2014.\u201cThe Modi government has already taken a number of positive steps for the economy in terms of ease of doing business, inflation moderation policies and even legislative reforms around coal, mining, labour and insurance...The govt has a majority mandate for four more years but will the above (the decline in popularity) lead to some short-term populist measures?\u201d asks analyst Gautam Chhaochharia, head of research (India) at UBS, who has authored the report.The government has already announced certain measures like a 50 per cent increase in compensation for crop damage brought on by unseasonal rain. Banks have been asked by the government to restructure loans given to farmers impacted by the crop damage. \u201cMr Modi might be using this as a way to balance any loss of political capital in pushing for the Land Acquisition Bill,\u201d the report said.However, it also notes, these measures might be \u201csocially justifiable, given adversities faced by farmers, is arguably not a freebie and, thus, not exactly populist\u201d.On the issue of imposing Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) prior to FY16 on FPIs, the report said it could be a repeat of 2012, when foreign investors withdrew money from Indian equities over worries about implementation of GAAR (General Anti-Avoidance Rules) on tax. This time, though, the global appetite for risk is in favour of India, the report said.Foreign investors have invested more than Rs 1 lakh crore in Indian stocks in each of the previous three calendar years. MAT is applicable on the income earned by FPIs and, from media reports, the total value of notices issued to its defaulters are $5-6 billion and could go higher.

The company has challenged this in court.\u201c...these are potential red flags which investors should not ignore,\u201d the report said.However, it said, economic recovery, while lower than market expectations, was still better than what is being projected.

Even the market regulator, which seeks to restrict information asymmetry through disclosure norms, has little control over what is prevented from being published in this manner.Prevention of the publishing of material information or analysis that might have significant impact on stock prices through such bullying should ideally be prosecuted as an unfair trade practice by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).

The high-value crop was hit last season due to flash floods in the Kashmir region.Saffron is grown in 3,674 hectares in Kashmir and 90 per cent of it is grown in the Pampore uplands. The floods damaged almost 100 per cent crop in 2,017 hectares. In 1,604 hectares, only 30 per cent could be salvaged.According to the state agriculture department, J&amp;K produced 3.83 tonnes and an estimated 11.17 tonnes was lost due to heavy downpour. This amounts to a loss of Rs 860 crore.The annual demand for saffron in India is about 100 tonnes. The huge demand gap is largely filled by imported saffron, mostly from Iran. Spurious saffron is also seen as a cause of worry. The objective of the government's National Saffron Mission is to meet three-fourths of the demand domestically.The state registered a yield of 4.5 kg per hectare in 2013, with a total production of 15 million tonnes. But the production fell drastically in the subsequent year due to excess rain. The crop season for saffron is from March/April to September/October.If the rains do not persist, farmers hope to get a maximum of 3.5 kg a hectare. \"The assessment can be done only after flowering starts in the months of June/July,\" said a senior official in the department, adding saffron is grown on highlands with a slanting landscape so the probability of waterlogging is less.Farmers who lost their crops are short of funds, as they did not get any aid from the state government.

This left steelmakers disappointed. More recently, however, Steel Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said, \"The industry and the government are equally worried about China dumping steel here. We have told the finance ministry about the compulsion for higher steel import duty. We are hoping for a favourable outcome.\"Narendran complains about the arrival of a lot of China-origin steel. But South Korea and Japan, which under free trade agreements (FTAs), are selling steel here under falling rates of import duty are also causing market disturbances. Making the best of major devaluation of local currencies rouble and hryvnia, steel groups in Russia and Ukraine are exporting steel in a big way. India continues to receive a good amount of steel from the two countries. If Chinese exporters are not restrained, they will continue to sell more and more products here. Considering the state of our steel industry, Delhi should give serious consideration to industry suggestion of removing steel from the purview of FTA. The industry's case will become stronger if it could back up the demand for taking out steel from the two FTAs with \"adequate facts and figures\" for New Delhi to intercede with Tokyo and Seoul.On a few occasions, Prime Minister Narendra Modi suggested that the steel industry would be playing a pivotal role in taking the 'Make in India' programme forward. Delhi's target is to raise the share of manufacturing sector in GDP from the current about 15 per cent to 25 per cent and in the process create an additional 100 million jobs by 2022. It will only be appropriate that the manufacturing sector as it rapidly expands should be using India-made steel. The country is targeting steel capacity growth of 300 mt by 2025 in which all major producers have plans to participate in a big way. But they will be crimped from doing so if imports continue to play havoc.A point not to be missed is that China, where growth has slowed and investment in infrastructure and construction fallen stepped up exports by 51 per cent in 2014 to 93.78 mt, much to the annoyance of steelmakers in the EU, the US and here. They remain sceptical that Beijing cancelling export tax rebates for steel alloys containing hardening chemical boron will lead to restraining of Chinese exports. As the Chinese prime minister is keen to consolidate the economy, GDP growth will stay around seven per cent a year. He is also pushing hard to end corruption among bureaucrats and politicians and scrap environment polluting and uneconomic steel capacity in the face of opposition from provincial satraps.All this boils down to flat steel demand in China, where double digit consumption growth became routine since the turn of the century. Morgan Stanley says demand for finished steel in China slid one per cent to 689 mt in 2014 marking a break with years of rapid growth. Contraction in production in the first two months of 2015 by 1.5 per cent to 130.5 mt on a year-on-year basis is confirmation of China Iron and Steel Association stand that production in the world's largest producer has \"already hit a peak\".

Analysts and investors suggested the deal could face potential opposition from the French government, which has previously said it sees the communications industry as strategic, and is sensitive about any potential job cuts.Shares in Alcatel were nearly 11% higher at \u20ac4.28 in mid-morning trading on the Paris stock exchange on Tuesday morning.

But the dull old telecoms equipment business left in Finland has turned out some rather exciting returns for loyal investors, who've seen their shares double in value over the last two years. Nokia has cut costs and has even started making new devices, with a tablet aimed at the Chinese market. A merger with Alcatel Lucent, another telecoms maker fallen on hard times, might not appear an obvious winner. But together, the two firms would hope to provide real competition to Sweden's Ericsson and, in particular, China's Huawei, which has grabbed a big share of the market as 4G networks are rolled out. Comebacks are rare in the technology world, but Nokia's investors may look at how Microsoft is doing with mobile phones and reflect that they got the best end of that deal.

Although robot waiters probably aren't going mainstream anytime soon, technology is fundamentally changing the way restaurants work\n                    \n                In the future, our restaurant tables will be computerised. We will summon more wine at the flick of a button, watch our morsels' preparation through a ChefCam, then speed into the night unhindered by waiting for our bill.At London's Inamo Restaurant in Soho, the future began six years ago.Co-founders Noel Hunwick and Daniel Potter had been friends at Oxford and fellow students in Magdalen College.Says Mr Hunwick, \"We were reconnecting at a restaurant and thought we really wanted to spend some money, and buy some beer.\"The waiter was sluggish, and the friends' thirst led them to devise broad contours of an 'E-Table'.Now the E-Table is patented technology, and the mainstay of the Soho restaurant and a second eatery in St James's.\"So it has its foundation in wanting another beer, but so do the best ideas, really,\" he says.Match.com lists Inamo in the top places for first dates in London.You can tweak the lighting, joust at Battleship, and when your meal is over, you can pay quickly, without waiting for a waiter.In a timeframe of 30 seconds instead of five minutes, says Mr Hunwick.Good if you don't like your date that much.\n                        Diners at Inamo\n                    \n                Dinner is servered\"If you look at restaurants in ancient Rome, they're not that different from restaurants today,\" says Rajat Suri, founder of Silicon Valley-based E la Carte.Mr Suri left a doctoral programme at MIT to work tables at an Irish pub in Cambridge, Massachusetts.He ended up cooking up a touchscreen restaurant tablet, the Presto, which the American chain Applebee's has signed a deal to deploy across its 1,800 restaurants.After dining one evening with seven MIT engineers, his group had difficulty splitting the bill.\"Sort of a bad joke\", admits Mr Suri.\n                        The Presto tablet, with a card swipe slot visible at the top\n                    \n                And restaurants are conservative, he came to realise.\"Software and technology have been inundating all parts of our lives - our homes, cars, and flights - but restaurants really have been passed by.\"This means, for an engineer, a host of inefficiencies and lost information in decisions and transactions.All in a sector known for thin margins, which perhaps can use all the help it can get.\"The restaurant space is not an early adopter of tech\", agrees John Regal of Ziosk, a Texas-based company whose tabletop tablet has recently been adopted by US chains Chili's and Red Robin.Across the Atlantic, dining tech has moved passed the innovator and early adopter stages, and into the \"early majority\" phase, says Mr Regal.Diners now come already accustomed to mobile devices and tablets. And restaurants form part of a \"race to the fifth screen\" in users' lives, after their television, computer, mobile, and tablet.This screen is likely to be communal, in places like airports and retail stores, and will feature apps you wouldn't download, but in a dressing room would be useful in the moment, predicts Mr Regal.1,500 restaurants now use the Ziosk, and a roughly comparable number Presto.\n                        The Ziosk tablet\n                    \n                Haute-techAlongside tabletop tech, what Inamo's Mr Hunwick calls queue-busting technology are being experimented with, such as tablets restaurants could hand to waiting customers to allow them to make a start on ordering.And with portable credit card scanners still a rarity across the Atlantic, much of the lure of dining tablets for American customers comes from the possibility - new, there - of paying at the table. But it is still a small sector. Most in it describe restaurants as a slow sell, initially.\"An overnight success that has been over seven years in the making,\" is how Mr Regal describes Ziosk.This challenge was magnified from a need to combine the perspectives of a technologist with those of a restaurant manager, adds Mr Hunwick, \"a bustling environment with seven glasses, chopsticks, and food on each table.\"Technically, the hardest obstacle for Inamo was allowing two people to use a mouse at the same time on a computer, something its lead software developer Bernard Sumption calls \"pretty surely a world first\".\n                        Customers can play games, order food and drinks\n                    \n                Inamo combines ceiling projectors with a table interface. Ziosk and Presto use tablet technology. And in Ukraine, Dmytro Kostyk and his Interactive Restaurant Technologies developed a touch-screen table with a sturdy enough glass top to bear the punishment of a restaurant. Each has had time to tinker, to incorporate gestures borrowed from tablets, and to play with different menu trees. For example, the first five items listed get ordered fifty per cent more, says Mr Hunwick.But their moment seems to have come. E la Carte attracted $13.5m (\u00a39.1m, \u20ac12.5m) in Series B funding from Intel Capital and Romulus Capital. Ziosk says it has signed contracts and commitments to double its restaurant footprint to 3,000 by year's end. Imano is looking to expand next year, and has been developing technology to shift tables and projectors around more freely. \"It was kind of magical. After years of writing code, I pressed the button to bring me more wine, and it just turned up,\" says Imano's Mr Sumption, about when he finally dined in their restaurant.\n                        Interactive Restaurant Technology's table allows you to watch the kitchen while your food is being prepared\n                    \n                E-voilaEarly responses suggest the challenge might now lie less in the technology than its implementation. Last month Gaurav Tiwari, from UK financial technology company Zapp, visited two restaurants of a burger chain which had recently acquired queue-busting tablets, to find in both stores the devices were uncharged and unused. One manager in agreed to charge one to allow Mr Tiwari to use it, which took ten minutes.Sean Williams, a contributor to personal finance website The Motley Fool, visited an Applebee's restaurant that had recently adopted the Presto tablet. He was struck by how much time waiters were taking to explain the device to customers, and that initial drink orders (including non-alcoholic ones) still needed to be placed with a waiter. But most online reviews of Inamo focus, in the end, on the food.\"After a bit of time playing battleships and not talking to your date,\" says Mr Sumption, \"it becomes a very normal restaurant after a while.\"\n                        Fish fingers: We can all be grateful that this unsettlingly real robotic hand is unlikely to form part of the restaurant of the future - outside Japan at least\n                    \n                But what about waiters?According to Mr Suri - who was one - an \"unexpected delight\" has been their reactions.In the US, saving a waiter two trips to process a credit card increases table turnover - and tips.Making the system easy to learn for casual staff has been an important lesson, says Mr Hunwick.In the US, innovative restaurant tech has so far been concentrated at the burger-and-chips end of the market.Mr Suri thinks this will change. \"I think high cuisine still prides itself on being fully manual, and having lot of attention.\"\"I think over time, they'll rely more and more on some sort of tech,\" he says, \"especially for things like wine education, which guests might want to browse at their own leisure.\"\n    ", "newspaper": "BBC", "id": 780, "pubdate": "Tue, 14 Apr 2015 04:32:04 +0530", "title": "The future restaurant is here"}]}
