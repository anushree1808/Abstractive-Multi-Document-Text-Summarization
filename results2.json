{"root":[{"title":"Airtel, Idea, RCOM drop on fears of fierce bidding","content":"Biswajit Baruah, ET Bureau Mar 28, 2015, 04.07AM IST(Reflecting the mood, analysts\u2026) MUMBAI: Shares of telecom companies such as Bharti Airtel, Idea Cellular and Reliance Communications (RCOM) dropped more than 5% on Friday on fears of aggressive bidding for airwaves, a development that may exert pressure on companies' balance sheets and cash flow, and restrict their expansion plans. Reflecting the mood, analysts maintained a cautious outlook on the sector, saying fresh buyers should stay away from this space in the near-term. On Friday, the department of telecommunications (DoT) released details of bidders at the recently concluded airwaves auction, where the government mopped up Rs 1.1 lakh crore from the spectrum put up for auction. The prices for the spectrum were considerably higher than the reserve price, said analysts. \"Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular have paid a little more for the spectrum than what the markets were expecting,\" said Mayuresh Joshi, VP, (institutional) Angel Broking. \"Going forward, Reliance Jio's pricing for its services would be closely watched. However, investors should note that the overhang on telecom stocks over spectrum is probably over.\" Telecom stocks came under intense selling pressure on Friday \u2014 Bharti Airtel fell 5.64% to Rs 376. Idea Cellular dropped 4.96% to Rs 171 after touching new 52-week high of Rs 187 in early trade. RCOM touched a new 52-week low of Rs 56.90 before closing at Rs 58.25, down 3.56%, while Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) ended 1.54% lower at Rs 7.68. Shares of some telecom companies \u2014 Bharti Airtel, Idea Cellular \u2014 have had a good run in the past one year, gaining 21% and 23%, respectively, while Reliance Communications dropped 53%; all these stocks have underperformed the ET 100 Index which gained nearly 27% over the same period. \"We reiterate our cautious view on the telecom sector, given the stretched balance sheets, rising capital expenditure, regulatory pushback, Reliance Jio's launch overhang, and expensive valuations,\" said Vinay Jaising, analyst at Morgan Stanley. They are also sceptical of Indian telecom companies due to a number of structural issues such as cannibalisation of voice by data, rapid expansion and network operational cost to deliver data, pricing impact from the imminent entry of Reliance Jio, and stretched balance sheets due to spectrum prices. \"Telcos will further bloat their balance sheet with debt, which is already under severe strain. We maintain 'hold' rating for Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular with a price target of Rs 399 and Rs 167\/share, respectively,\" said Amar Mourya, research analyst at IndiaNivesh. Most telecom companies may report negative free cash flow in 2015 as they are required to pay a quarter of the committed amount in the spectrum auction upfront, and the rest will be paid in installments over 10 years from 2017.","pubdate":"Sat, 28 Mar 2015 04:07:22 +0530","newspaper":"Economic Times"},{"title":"Sustained growth makes Kajaria Ceramics a good long-term bet","content":"Narendra Nathan, ET Bureau Jan 26, 2015, 08.00AM IST(Analysts say Kajaria Ceramics\u2026) We recommended Kajaria Ceramics a year back because of its high growth rate and decent valuations. The company has rewarded its investors by outperforming the benchmark index, Sensex, handsomely during this time. Kajaria Ceramics continues to grow at a fast pace. It has reported a 30 per cent growth in revenue in the third quarter of 2014-15 compared to the same quarter previous year. The net profit jumped 55 per cent because of a 29 per cent increase in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, and a fall in interest cost due to reduction in debt.  Analysts say Kajaria Ceramics will maintain its high growth in the coming years, largely because of conducive industry dynamics. For the past several years, the Indian tiles industry has been growing due to urbanisation, affordability of tiles, and consumers' focus on home aesthetics, aided by rising disposable incomes. This growth rate is expected to accelerate in the coming years because of the new government's increased focus on affordable housing and the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. Going by its performance, Kajaria should be able to beat the industry growth rates. In the next five years, Kajaria Ceramics is aiming to grow its revenue at a compound annual growth rate of 20 per cent. Close to 15 per cent of this growth will come from an increase in volume. The remaining will be a result of an increase in prices and a customer shift to premium brands. Kajaria Ceramics is also expanding capacity. It will be spending up to Rs 200 crore in the next fiscal year towards this purpose. Though the company will continue to focus on its tiles business, which accounts for 90 per cent of its turnover, it has entered the sanitaryware and sanitary-fittings segment. Its sanitaryware plant is already operational and is expected to reach full production by March 2015. Even though margins are expected to remain at the current 15 per cent-plus level, the fall in the natural gas price will bring down costs and should help the entire sector expand margins. The historical PE of 35 may appear high, but analysts say, because of the strong volume growth, pricing power, healthy margins and a strong balance sheet\u2014very low debt, which is being cut further\u2014it is justified. But, bear in mind, the company, and the entire Indian tiles industry, faces a threat from Chinese imports. Any policy shift that serves to boost tiles export from China, will adversely impact the entire industry, including Kajaria.

These companies are unlikely to reap the full impact of the festive season in the December 2014 quarter. The festive sales were split between September and December due to early Navratri and Diwali in 2014. Along summer and an early festive season led to a strong first half for these companies, giving many investors an impression that the demand has bounced back for discretionary products post-election. A base effect, thanks to lower sales in the year-ago period, also boosted the numbers and fuelled sentiment.  There was a growth of 27-57% in sales for the September quarter and 25-39% in the first half of FY15. The earnings growth figures were even higher. The result was a surge in stock prices (See table). But, random checks (while talking to dealers and mall outlets) suggest that the sales in the December quarter have been less than impressive. One spots a similar trend in other consumer discretionary sectors like passenger vehicles and two-wheelers. For instance, Hero Moto reported minus 2% growth YoY for the December quarter, Bajaj Auto recorded minus 1% growth YoY while M&amp;M closed the quarter minus 12% YoY growth. Maruti was an exception, generating a 12% growth YoY. While analysts are justifying current high valuations \u2014 claiming that these companies will benefit from the correction in steel, copper and aluminium prices \u2014 a weak sales growth may keep sentiments sombre.","pubdate":"Tue, 13 Jan 2015 05:14:13 +0530","newspaper":"Economic Times"},{"title":"Balkrishna Industries: A long-term bet after the recent correction","content":"Narendra Nathan, ET Bureau Jan 5, 2015, 08.00AM IST(Balkrishna Industries\u2026) The profits of Balkrishna Industries fell by around 40% after reporting poor numbers in the second quarter of 2014-15. The tyre company's net profit went down by 17% compared to the corresponding period last year and by 22% compared to the preceding quarter. Lower volume from European markets (the region contributes around 50% of its sales volume) and the discounts offered to clients to compensate the fall in natural rubber prices are the primary factors behind the fall in net profit.  Balkrishna Industries could not take advantage of the lower prices of natural rubber in the second quarter because it had a huge inventory of rubber purchased at higher prices. Rising employee costs following partial commissioning of its new tyre plant with 1.5 lakh per annum capacity in Bhuj, Gujarat, was another factor. The recent correction in its price has brought the valuations of Balkrishna Industries to reasonable levels. In addition to the fall in price, analysts are getting bullish on this niche player because of its improving fundamentals. Its Bhuj plant is expected to become fully operational by April 2015. This will help the company to foray into much bigger radial tyres (expected to move up from 35 inches to 57 inches) and, therefore, its tyre portfolio will be more comprehensive. Radial tyres have higher realisations (3-4% higher) and with this new plant, its radial sales volume is expected to move up from around 30% now to above 40% over the next three years. Balkrishna Industries is also working towards increasing its global market share in the off -highway tyres (OHT) from 5% to 8% in the next three years. To realise this goal, the company plans to set up warehouses in the US and other overseas markets in the near future to increase its penetration levels. Though the global fall in agricultural product prices has resulted in less demand for new tractors (lower demand for OEM tyres), existing tractors continue to work (normal demand for tyres in the replacement segment , which is nearly 80% of its total sales volumes). New tractor sales are also expected to improve following the stability in the American farm sector reported recently. With around 90% of its revenues coming from exports, Balkrishna Industries will also benefit from the sudden depreciation of the rupee in the last six months.

Orient Cement's per tonne cement production cost is around 13% lower than the industry average. Therefore, the company could repeat its stellar performance in the third quarter of 2014-15 as well. In its second quarter sales, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) and net profit grew by 20%, 123% and 200%, respectively, compared to the corresponding period last year, or on a year-on-year basis. The company could also improve its third quarter EBITDA per tonne to `785, which is among the highest in the industry. The rise in EBITDA per tonne was due to the strong volume growth (up by 4% y-o-y) and improvement in realisations (up by 15% y-o-y). Orient Cement is a good long-term bet because of the infrastructure growth expected in the company's two key markets\u2014Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh\u2014in the coming years. Industrial demand is expected to pick up in Maharashtra following the initiatives by the new state government. Andhra Pradesh, however, is the best example of the amount of harm political uncertainties can do to even well-established companies. The market size of cement has shrunk to 13 million tonnes in the state from the peak levels of 18 million tonnes in 2008-09. However, due to the low cost of production, Orient Cement could increase its market share.  Cement consumption should jump in Andhra Pradesh in the coming years as massive construction projects are lined up at the new state capital. To benefit from this, the mid-sized cement company is in the process of increasing capacity through green-field and brown-field projects. The company's 3 million tonne green-field project in Gulbarga (northern Karnataka) is progressing smoothly. Its trial production and, subsequently, commercial production is expected from April 2015 and June 2015, respectively. This project also includes a 45MW thermal plant and a 7MW waste-heat-recovery plant. Despite the key advantages, such as low-cost cement production, high return on equity (ROE) and return on capital employed (ROCE), this stock is still attractively priced compared to its peers.

While its net profit rose by 50% year-on-year, it zoomed by 98% on a quarter-on-quarter basis. The rise in net profit was primarily due to two factors: first, there was a 316% y-o-y jump in its other income which was triggered by the profit it made from sale of investments. Second, the company reported 14% y-o-y increase in rating revenues, which was significantly higher than the 5% achieved by its main competitor Crisil during the period under consideration. In addition to the increase in surveillance income, Care also added 761 clients during the quarter and its total volume of debt instruments rated increased by 16% y-o-y.  Analysts are now getting bullish on the long-term (2-3 years) growth opportunities for the credit rating sector because it is best placed to benefit from the cyclical recovery in corporate capex and bank credit growth. The sector is already doing well because of the pickup in debt issuances in the recent past. According to Prime Database, debt placements during the first half of 2014-15 went up by 22% compared to the corresponding period last year. Another factor helping credit rating agencies is the improvement in credit environment. For example, Care's modified credit ratio (MCR) has improved from 1.05 times to 1.25 times in the second quarter, y-o-y. MCR is calculated by dividing the number of rating upgrades with downgrades. An increase in MCR means that the financials of the rated companies are stable and improving. With a turnaround in the economy, MCR is expected to improve further in the second half of 2014-15. With the revival in market sentiments, debt issuances are expected to rise manifold, increasing business opportunities for rating agencies like Care. Since the company provides 'grading' for equity public offerings, revival in stock market sentiments also bodes well for it. While analysts are bullish on the sector, Care is their preferred choice. This is so because it is the cheapest stock based on valuations and the recent correction has brought down its valuations further to reasonable levels. It is quoting at 35 times trailing price-to earnings ratio compared to 51 times for Crisil and 45 for Icra. Care is also continuing with its liberal dividend policy and has announced 650% dividend during the second quarter, taking the total interim dividend announced in 2014-15 to 710%.

The shares fell to 1,865.5 yen ($17) in the first few minutes of frenzied trading, erasing most of the gains made since the start of the year, in response to Sony's announcement, which came after Japanese  markets had closed Wednesday. The company, whose dual-listed shares slid nearly 7.0 per cent in  New York, blamed the ballooning loss estimate on struggles at its mobile phone business, where it said it would cut staff by 15 per cent, or about 1,000 jobs. Demand for Sony's smartphones has come under increasing pressure from rivals including  Samsung and Apple, which is releasing its newest  iPhone in several key markets, including  Japan, this week. Sony also said it would not pay dividends for the first time since its shares started trading in Tokyo in 1958. The company, whose  credit rating has been slashed to junk, has issued a string of downward earnings revisions over the past two years as it undergoes a sweeping overhaul led by chief executive Kazuo Hirai. The restructuring has included thousands of layoffs, exiting the personal computer business and liquidating assets that saw the $1.0 billion sale of its Manhattan headquarters. News that the company was heading for a 230 billion yen ($2.14 billion) net loss in the fiscal year to March 2015 comes only months after it tipped a shortfall of just 50 billion yen, citing a turnaround in its television unit. The announcement was likely to resurrect fears that what used to be the world's leading electronics company has a lot more work ahead to cast off years of losses. Hirokazu Kabeya, senior strategist at  Daiwa Securities in Tokyo, said the share plunge was inevitable after the firm's latest worrying forecast. \"Market players are getting used to (Sony's downward revisions) but a temporary fall was still unavoidable,\" he said. Sony has been cutting expectations for sales in the money-losing smartphone business amid weaker-than-expected results in emerging markets and the soaring presence of rivals in its home market. \"Other firms are also offering new products with innovative technology -- this business experiences dramatic changes in products and services,\" Hirai told reporters in Tokyo when asked about struggles in the mobile phone unit. \"The environment is changing and becoming more severe,\" he added. Hirai, who took over in 2012, said Wednesday that the firm would continue to focus on more profitable areas of its vast business, which ranges from televisions and portable music to a movie division and little-known insurance business. Despite his bid to slim down the firm, Hirai has repeatedly shrugged off pleas to abandon a money-losing television division, which he insists remains central to Sony's core business. Japanese manufacturers have suffered badly in their TV divisions as razor-thin margins and fierce overseas competition hammered profits. Kabeya at Daiwa Securities said Sony cannot afford to get into a price war with lower-cost rivals, including Chinese smartphone makers, or beat Samsung and  Apple in global market share. \"It is difficult to cut into the dominance of the big two: Samsung and Apple,\" Kabeya said. \"(Sony) would be wise to shift its business resources to where it is strong -- such as movies and music.\" Following Thursday's share price drop, investors may take a step back and see Hirai's efforts to slim down the company as a positive, Kabeya said. \"But it's unlikely we'll see a rapid turnaround and the company will likely continue to go through a difficult time for a while,\" he added.

Spot gold climbed 0.8 per cent to $1,204.06 an ounce by 1431 GMT. Flat initially, it gained momentum after a break of technical resistance at $1,196 that triggered automatic buy orders. \"This move is coming during a week when we didn't really have any gold-positive news but ...the way gold is putting up a fight at the moment is potentially giving some confidence to the market,\" Saxo Bank senior manager Ole Hansen said. \"But to make headwinds above the resistance area around $1,225 we need to see some real buying coming in.\" Bullion was however still down around 0.3 per cent for the week, having pulled back from Monday's seven-week top of $1,224.10 that was triggered by last week's weak US employment report. US gold for June delivery was up $13.70 an ounce at $1,207.20. \"We saw a technical move this morning that pushed prices above $1,200... but if we see some selling into the rally perhaps we can come back down again,\"  Mitsubishi Corp strategist  Jonathan Butler said. \"Looking at the slightly longer-term chart, (prices are) still heading for a weekly fall ... (after) what we heard at the FOMC meeting, very much keeping the door  open to a June rate rise.\" Gold on Friday shrugged off the impact of a stronger dollar and higher global equities. But the longer-term outlook is still bearish, traders said, and prices had surrendered gains after  Federal Reserve officials suggested a June rate hike could still be in play. Investors tend to shun gold, which doesn't pay interest, when market expectations point to US interest rates rising. Gold could drop to a five-year low of $1,100 this year due to the relative health of the US economy compared to Europe and emerging  markets, GFMS analysts at Thomson Reuters said. Gold buying in Asia was slow this week as firmer spot prices turned off buyers, especially in China, and a potentially weak monsoon threatened demand in India. Premiums for physical gold at the Shanghai Gold Exchange stood at a modest $1-$2 an ounce over the global spot  benchmark on Friday. Spot  silver rose 2.7 per cent to $16.55 an ounce, while platinum gained 1.2 per cent to $1,168.79 an ounce and palladium was up 1.7 per cent at $773 an ounce.

Fresh dollar demand from banks and importers in the view of firm dollar in the overseas market mainly affected the rupee value against dollar, a  forex dealer said.

The dollar index, a gauge of six major global rivals, was up by 0.38 per cent today. The greenback rose to three-week highs against the euro and the yen in the New York market yesterday, recouping all the losses made after disappointing jobs data last week that caste doubt on the strength of the US labour market.

At 0750 GMT the rouble was up 1.5 percent against the dollar at 51.08 and 2 percent stronger at 54.25 against the euro, setting new new 2015 highs. The rouble has risen 10 percent against the dollar this week, taking many analysts by surprise as the Russian currency has largely decoupled from the oil price which is typically its key driver. On Friday international oil benchmark Brent was little changed at $56.55 per barrel, up around $1 since the start of the week. BCS analyst Mark Bradford said in a note that the rouble was being supported by the calm situation in eastern Ukraine, where February's Minsk peace deal appears to be holding following months of fighting between government forces and separatists. \"All the same one can't exclude a (downward) correction for both the rouble and stock indexes,\" he wrote, estimating the rouble's fair value at 57-58 per dollar at current oil prices. Analysts at Rosbank said that the rouble was being buoyed by attractive rouble interest rates on currency forwards and local treasury bonds, as well as technical factors. \"The USD\/RUB pair is approaching the level of the 200-day average (49.44 roubles per dollar), which strengthens the strategy of selling foreign currency,\" they wrote. Russian stock indexes were mixed on Friday, with strong gains in the dollar-denominated RTS index which is boosted by a stronger rouble. At 0750 GMT the RTS was up 2.8 percent to 1,031 points while the rouble-based MICEX index was down 0.3 percent to 1,662.
